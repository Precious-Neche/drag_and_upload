00:00:25,297 --> 00:00:27,264
(* The Gabe Dixon Band: Find My Way)

00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:32,337
(birds chirping)

3
00:01:21,713 --> 00:01:23,536
Shit!

4
00:01:42,768 --> 00:01:44,710
(indistinct chattering)

5
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,081
Andrew, hey.

6
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:51,571
Here you go. Your regular lattes.

7
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:55,703
Literally saved my life.
Thank you. Thank you.

8
00:01:56,882 --> 00:01:58,606
(honking)

9
00:02:09,228 --> 00:02:10,439
(elevator dinging)

10
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:11,545
- Everyone OK?
- Yeah.

11
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,802
- Yeah.
- Me too.

12
00:02:15,334 --> 00:02:18,497
Hello, Frank?
How's my favorite writer?

13
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,264
Of course you've been
thinking about our talk

14
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:21,966
because you know I'm right.

15
00:02:22,074 --> 00:02:23,897
Frank, people in this
country are busy, broke,

16
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:26,018
and they hate to read.
They need someone they can trust to say,

17
00:02:26,144 --> 00:02:28,381
"Hey! Don't watch
CSl: Indianapolis tonight.

18
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:31,777
Read a book! Read Frank's book."
And that person is Oprah.

19
00:02:35,254 --> 00:02:37,142
(indistinct chatter)

20
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,915
- Cuttin' it close.
- One of those mornings.

21
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,454
Thank you, Captain Obvious.

22
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:42,731
- (both grunting)
- Sweet...

23
00:02:42,861 --> 00:02:44,455
- Uh, sorry.
...Jesus!

24
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,386
- (laughter)
- (man) Rub some dirt on it, brother.

25
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,816
Frank, the truth is all
A-plus novelists do publicity.

26
00:02:50,903 --> 00:02:53,587
Roth, McCourt, Russo, and...

27
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:56,522
Frank! Can I tell you what else
they have in common? A Pulitzer.

28
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,197
I need the shirt off
your back. Literally.

29
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:02,630
- You're kidding, right?
- Yankees, Boston, this Tuesday,

30
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:05,116
two company seats for your shirt.
You have five seconds to decide.

31
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,844
Five, four, three, two, one.

32
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:08,382
- (laughing)
- I know...

33
00:03:08,487 --> 00:03:10,659
- Shh!
- Later.

34
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:17,751
- (gasps)
- Uh-oh.

35
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,903
- (popping sound)
- (clears throat)

36
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:25,516
(popping sound on numerous computers)

37
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,614
Uh, hello. Hello?

38
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,234
Morning, boss. You have a
conference call in 30 minutes.

39
00:03:36,348 --> 00:03:38,236
Yes. About the marketing
of the spring books. I know.

40
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:39,661
Staff meeting at 9:00.

41
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:41,246
Did you call, um...
(groans) Wha's her name?

42
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:43,689
The one with the ugly hands.

43
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:44,805
- Janet.
- Yes, Janet.

44
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:46,231
Yes. I did call her. I told her that

45
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:47,951
if she doesn't get her
manuscript in on time

46
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,362
you won't give her a release date.
Your immigration lawyer called.

47
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:51,576
He said its imperative...

48
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,257
Cancel the call, push
the meeting to tomorrow

49
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,741
and keep the lawyer on the sheets.

50
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,242
Oh, and get a hold of PR,

51
00:03:56,335 --> 00:03:57,709
have them start drafting
a press release.

52
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,210
Frank is doing Oprah.

53
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,726
Wow. Nicely done.

54
00:04:01,873 --> 00:04:04,941
If I want your praise,
I will ask for it.

55
00:04:07,145 --> 00:04:09,001
Um...

56
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:10,708
Who is, uh, who is Jillian?

57
00:04:10,816 --> 00:04:13,403
And why does she want me to call her?

58
00:04:16,722 --> 00:04:18,577
Well, that was originally my cup.

59
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,580
And I'm drinking your coffee why?

60
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:22,635
Because your coffee spilled.

61
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:32,078
So, you drink unsweetened
cinnamon light soy lattes?

62
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:35,206
I do. Its like Christmas in a cup.

63
00:04:35,374 --> 00:04:36,749
Is that a coincidence?

64
00:04:36,842 --> 00:04:39,143
- Incredibly, it is.
- (phone ringing)

65
00:04:39,277 --> 00:04:41,351
I mean I wouldn't possibly drink
the same coffee that you drink

66
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,041
just in case yours spilled.

67
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,872
That would be pathetic.

68
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:46,925
Morning. Miss Tate's office.

69
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,297
Hey, Bob.

70
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:53,121
Actually, we're headed to
your office right now. Yeah.

71
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:55,943
Why are we headed to Bob's office?

72
00:04:56,094 --> 00:04:58,484
- (tsks)
- (tsks)

73
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,452
(tsks)

74
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,396
- (popping sound)
- (multiple pops)

75
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,520
(gasps) Oop!

76
00:05:11,976 --> 00:05:13,504
Have you finished the
manuscript I gave you?

77
00:05:13,612 --> 00:05:16,066
Uh, I read a few pages.
I wasn't that impressed.

78
00:05:16,214 --> 00:05:17,524
- Can I say something?
- No.

79
00:05:17,615 --> 00:05:19,591
I've read thousands of manuscripts,

80
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,061
and this is the only one
I've given you.

81
00:05:21,153 --> 00:05:22,812
There's an incredible novel in there.

82
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,744
The kind of novel you used to publish.

83
00:05:24,856 --> 00:05:28,021
Uh, wrong. And I do think you
order the same coffee as I do

84
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:30,584
just in case you spill,
which is, in fact, pathetic.

85
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:31,941
- Or impressive.
- I'd be impressed

86
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,208
if you didn't spill in the first place.

87
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,673
Now remember, you're
just a prop in here.

88
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,655
- Won't say a word.
- (clears throat)

89
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:43,940
Ah! Our fearless leader and
her liege. Please, do come in.

90
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,656
Oh. Beautiful breakfront. Is it new?

91
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,749
It is English Regency Egyptian
Revival, built in the 1800s

92
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,633
but, yes, it is new to my office.

93
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:55,347
Witty.

94
00:05:55,454 --> 00:05:57,974
Bob, I'm letting you go.

95
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,676
Pardon?

96
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:05,730
I asked you over a dozen times to get
Frank to do Oprah, and you didn't do it.

97
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:07,906
You're fired.

98
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,495
I have told you that is impossible.

99
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,907
Frank hasn't done an
interview in 20 years.

100
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,665
(Tate) Well that is
interesting, because I just

101
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:18,164
got off the phone
with him, and he is in.

102
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,887
Excuse me?

103
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,322
You didn't even call him, did you?

104
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,441
- But...
- I know, I know.

105
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,649
Frank can be a little scary
to deal with. For you.

106
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,920
Now, I will give you two
months to find another job.

107
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,458
And then you can tell
everyone you resigned, OK?

108
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,637
Whats his twenty?

109
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:44,279
He's moving. He has crazy eyes.

110
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,478
Don't do it, Bob. Don't do it.

111
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:50,434
- You poisonous bitch!
- (all gasp)

112
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,236
You can't fire me!

113
00:06:52,344 --> 00:06:54,548
You don't think I see
what you're doing here?

114
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,370
Sandbagging me on this Oprah thing

115
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,304
just so that you can
look good to the board?

116
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:01,286
Because you are threatened by me!

117
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:04,203
- And you are a monster.
- Bob, stop.

118
00:07:04,356 --> 00:07:07,521
Just because you have
no semblance of a life

119
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,384
outside of this office,

120
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,535
you think that you can treat all of us

121
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:13,257
like your own personal slaves.

122
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:15,821
You know what? I feel sorry for you.

123
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,587
Because you know what you're
gonna have on your deathbed?

124
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,678
Nothing and no one.

125
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:25,475
(breathes deeply)

126
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,105
Listen carefully, Bob.

127
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,661
I didn't fire you because
I feel threatened. No.

128
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,112
I fired you because you're
lazy, entitled, incompetent

129
00:07:34,286 --> 00:07:35,879
and you spend more time
cheating on your wife

130
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,264
than you do in your office.

131
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:38,633
And if you say another word,

132
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,929
Andrew here is gonna have you
thrown out on your ass, OK?

133
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,482
Another word and you're
going out of here

134
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,840
with an armed escort.

135
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,718
Andrew will film it with
his little camera phone

136
00:07:46,832 --> 00:07:48,393
and he will put it
on that Internet site.

137
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:49,680
- What was it?
- YouTube?

138
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,103
Exactly. Is that what you want?

139
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,799
Didn't think so. I have work to do.

140
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,078
(all murmuring)

141
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,150
Have security take his
breakfront out of his office

142
00:07:58,276 --> 00:07:59,356
and put it in my conference room.

143
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:00,427
Will do.

144
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:01,561
And I need you around this weekend

145
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:02,957
to help review his files
and his manuscript.

146
00:08:03,048 --> 00:08:05,536
- This weekend?
- You have a problem with that?

147
00:08:05,684 --> 00:08:07,626
No. I... just my
grandmother's 90th birthday,

148
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:09,095
so I was gonna go home and...

149
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,912
...its fine. I'll cancel it.

150
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,879
You're actually saving me from
a weekend of misery anyway,

151
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,195
so its... good talk, yeah.

152
00:08:15,327 --> 00:08:20,216
I know, I know. OK, tell
Gammy I'm sorry. OK? What...

153
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:21,961
Mom. What do you want me to tell you?

154
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:24,401
She's making me work the weekend.

155
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:25,782
No, I'm not... no.

156
00:08:25,871 --> 00:08:27,365
Listen, I've worked too
hard for this promotion

157
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:28,520
to throw it all away, OK?

158
00:08:28,606 --> 00:08:30,036
I'm sure that Dad is pissed,

159
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:32,924
but we take all of our submissions
around here very seriously.

160
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:36,340
We'll get back to
you as soon as we can.

161
00:08:36,514 --> 00:08:38,424
- Was that your family?
- Yes.

162
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,209
- They tell you to quit?
- Every single day.

163
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:43,386
Miss Tate's office.

164
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:46,142
Oh... Yeah. OK. All right.

165
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,299
Bergen and Malloy want to
see you upstairs immediately.

166
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,916
(groans) OK. Come get me in ten
minutes. We've got a lot to do.

167
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,046
Okey-doke.

168
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,028
(phone ringing)

169
00:08:57,736 --> 00:08:59,362
Good morning, Miss Tate.

170
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,583
Jack, Edwin.

171
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,400
Margaret, congratulations
on the Oprah thing.

172
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:07,300
- Thats terrific news.
- Thank you, thank you.

173
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:10,163
This isn't about my second raise, is it?
(chuckles) Just kidding.

174
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:13,797
Margaret, do you
remember when we agreed

175
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,928
that you wouldn't go to
the Frankfurt Book Fair

176
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,397
because you weren't allowed
out of the country

177
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:19,312
while your visa application
was being processed?

178
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:20,408
Yes. I do.

179
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,761
And... you went to Frankfurt.

180
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,001
Yes, I did. We were going
to lose DeLillo to Viking.

181
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,073
So... really didn't
have a choice, did I?

182
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,508
It seems that the
United States Government

183
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:30,543
doesn't care much who
publishes Don DeLillo.

184
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:33,321
We, uh, just spoke to
your immigration attorney.

185
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,993
Great. So, we're all good?
Everything good?

186
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,507
Margaret, your visa application
has been denied.

187
00:09:38,643 --> 00:09:41,678
- (stammers)
- And you are being deported.

188
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:42,927
Deported?

189
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:44,642
And apparently there
was also some paperwork

190
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,060
that you didn't fill out in time.

191
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:50,428
Come on. Come on! Its not
like I'm even an immigrant!

192
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,566
I'm from Canada, for Chris's sake.

193
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,960
There's gotta be... there's
gotta be something we can do.

194
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,982
We can reapply, but unfortunately

195
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,966
you have to leave the country
for at least a year.

196
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:06,836
OK. OK, well, thats
not ideal, but, uh...,

197
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,796
I can, uh... I can manage
everything from Toronto...

198
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:10,020
(Bergen) No, Margaret.

199
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,353
...with videoconferencing
and Internet.

200
00:10:11,443 --> 00:10:12,523
(Malloy) Unfortunately, Margaret,

201
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:15,196
if you're deported,
you can't work for an American company.

202
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,649
Until this is resolved I'm going
to turn operations over

203
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:18,928
to Bob Spaulding.

204
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,571
Bob Spaulding? The guy I just fired?

205
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,063
We need an editor in chief.

206
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:25,424
He is the only person in the building
who has enough experience.

207
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:27,314
- You cannot be serious. I beg of you.
- Margaret.

208
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:29,314
We are desperate to have you stay.

209
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:32,275
If there was any way, any way at all

210
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:33,925
that we could make this work,
we'd be doing it.

211
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,113
- (knocking)
- (Margaret) There is no way...

212
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,182
I am begging you.

213
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:37,829
No, Margaret. Excuse me,
we're in a meeting.

214
00:10:37,936 --> 00:10:39,431
- Sorry to interrupt.
- What? What!

215
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:41,993
Mary from Miss Winfrey's office
called. She's on the line.

216
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,156
- I know.
- (Andrew) She's on hold.

217
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:46,058
She needs to speak with you right away.
I told her you were otherwise engaged.

218
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:48,665
She insisted, so... sorry.

219
00:10:48,813 --> 00:10:50,374
So...

220
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:02,369
Uh... (mouthing)

221
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,035
(whispering) Come here.

222
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:11,144
Uh... Gentlemen, I understand.
I understand...

223
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:14,303
the predicament that we are in.

224
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,067
And, um...

225
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:20,127
And there's, uh... well...

226
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,800
I think there's something
that you should know.

227
00:11:24,249 --> 00:11:27,510
Uh... we're, uh...
we're getting married.

228
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,694
We are getting married.

229
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:31,383
- Who is getting married?
- You and I.

230
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,140
You and I are getting married! Yes.

231
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,886
- We are.
- Getting married.

232
00:11:35,994 --> 00:11:37,369
- (mumbling) We are getting married.
- Yes.

233
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,206
Isn't he your secretary?

234
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,348
Assistant.

235
00:11:42,434 --> 00:11:46,012
Executive, uh...
assistant secretary. Titles.

236
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:50,297
But, wouldn't be the first time
one of us fell for our secretaries.

237
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,418
Would it, Edwin?

238
00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:54,684
(Margaret) With Laquisha. Remember?

239
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:58,196
So, yeah... The truth is,

240
00:11:58,383 --> 00:12:02,345
you know, Andrew and I, we're...
we are just two people

241
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,626
who weren't meant to
fall in love but we did.

242
00:12:04,756 --> 00:12:06,033
No.

243
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:10,948
All those late nights at the
office and weekend book fairs.

244
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,210
- Yeah...
- No.

245
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:14,850
- Something happened.
- Something.

246
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yeah. Tried to fight it and...

247
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:19,732
Can't, can't fight a...

248
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,115
Can't fight a love like ours, so, uh...

249
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:27,605
Uh... Are we good with this?
Are you happy?

250
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,490
Because, well... we are happy. So happy.

251
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:32,763
- (Bergen) Margaret.
- Yes?

252
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:34,674
Its terrific.

253
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:36,445
Just make it legal. Mmm?

254
00:12:36,554 --> 00:12:39,075
Oh! Legal. (chuckles)

255
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:42,421
Yeah, well, then...
then that means we...

256
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,797
...we need to get ourselves
to the immigration office.

257
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,451
So we can work this
whole mess out. Right?

258
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,388
(Margaret) Thank you
very much, gentlemen.

259
00:12:49,501 --> 00:12:50,516
We will do that right away.

260
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,707
Thank you very much,
gentlemen. Thank you.

261
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,977
- Gentlemen.
- Thank you.

262
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,628
(popping)

263
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,663
(woman whispers) Margaret
and Andrew are getting married!

264
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,022
(woman #2) What is that about?

265
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,088
(man whispering) Dragon Lady!
Here they come...

266
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:04,492
(snickering) Yeah.

267
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:06,273
(woman #3) What is he thinking?

268
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:07,432
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

269
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,461
(indistinct chatter)

270
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:12,076
Dude, for real. Her? (laughing)

271
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:14,395
(woman #4) Married? Didn't
even know they were dating...

272
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,421
(Margaret clears throat)

273
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,239
(clearing throat)

274
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:37,430
What?

275
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,673
I don't understand whats happening.

276
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:42,675
(Margaret) Relax. This is for you, too.

277
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:44,065
Do explain.

278
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,295
They were going to make Bob chief.

279
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,018
So naturally I would have to marry you.

280
00:13:48,126 --> 00:13:49,653
(Margaret) And whats the problem?

281
00:13:49,761 --> 00:13:51,997
Like you were saving yourself
for someone special?

282
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:55,131
I like to think so.
Besides, its illegal.

283
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,366
They're looking for terrorists,
not for book publishers.

284
00:13:58,538 --> 00:13:59,999
- Margaret.
- Yes?

285
00:14:00,104 --> 00:14:03,040
- I'm not gonna marry you.
- Sure you are.

286
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:06,110
Because if you don't marry me, your
dreams of touching the lives of millions

287
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:07,935
with the written word are dead.

288
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,373
Bob is gonna fire you the second
I'm gone. Guaranteed.

289
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,496
That means you're out on the street
alone looking for a job.

290
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:21,013
That means all the time that
we spent together, all the lattes,

291
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:23,264
all the canceled dates,
all the midnight Tampax runs,

292
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:26,559
were all for nothing and all your dreams
of being an editor are gone.

293
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:29,034
But don't worry, after the required
allotment of time,

294
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:30,574
we'll get a quickie divorce
and you'll be done with me.

295
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,426
But until then, like it or not,

296
00:14:32,537 --> 00:14:34,391
your wagon is hitched to mine. OK?

297
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,612
- (phone ringing)
- Phone.

298
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:46,690
(indistinct chatter)

299
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,550
- This way.
- Margaret.

300
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:54,600
- (hisses) Come.
- The line...

301
00:14:54,726 --> 00:14:55,708
Next, please.

302
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,354
Ooh, ooh. Just, uh...

303
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:58,924
Sorry, I just need to ask him something.

304
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,714
I need for you to file this
fiancée visa for me, please.

305
00:15:03,268 --> 00:15:04,698
(scoffs)

306
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:08,773
- Miss Tate?
- Yes.

307
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,881
Please, come with me.

308
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:13,465
(woman) Yes, ma'am, I understand
that. We're backed up...

309
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:16,885
I have a bad feeling about this.

310
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:17,997
(knocking)

311
00:15:20,652 --> 00:15:21,962
- Hi. Hello.
- Hello.

312
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:24,444
Hi. I'm Mr. Gilbertson.

313
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,565
- Ah!
- And you must be Andrew,

314
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:27,969
- and you must be...
- Margaret.

315
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,784
...Margaret. Sorry about the wait.

316
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:31,488
Its a, uh, crazy day today.

317
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,669
Oh, of course, of course. We understand.

318
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,741
And I can't tell you how much
we appreciate you seeing us

319
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:39,762
- on such short notice.
- OK. (sighs)

320
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,361
* Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh
buh, buh, buh, buuuh

321
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,263
So, I have one question for you.

322
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:47,443
Are you both committing fraud
to avoid her deportation

323
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:51,541
so she can keep her position
as editor in chief at Colden Books?

324
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,294
- Thats ridiculous.
- Where did you hear that?

325
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,624
We had a phone tip this afternoon
from a man named...

326
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:59,448
Would it be Bob Spaulding?

327
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,835
Bob Spaulding.

328
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:04,091
Bob. Poor Bob. I am so sorry.

329
00:16:04,262 --> 00:16:08,037
Bob is nothing but a disgruntled
former employee.

330
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:09,280
And I apologize.

331
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:11,954
But we know you're incredibly busy

332
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:15,814
with a room full of gardeners
and delivery boys to tend to.

333
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,503
If you just give us our next step,

334
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,551
we will be out of your
hair and on our way.

335
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:22,240
Miss Tate, please.

336
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:27,676
Let me explain to you the
process thats about to unfold.

337
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:31,148
Step one will be a scheduled interview.

338
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,705
I'll put you each in a room,
and I'll ask you every little question

339
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,781
that a real couple
would know about each other.

340
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:40,922
Step two, I dig deeper.
I look at your phone records,

341
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:43,369
I talk to your neighbors,
I interview your coworkers.

342
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:45,836
If your answers don't match up
at every point,

343
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:48,525
you will be deported indefinitely.

344
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,974
And you, young man,
will have committed a felony...

345
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:54,938
- (woman shouting in Spanish)
...punishable by a fine of $250,000

346
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:59,206
and a stay of five years
in federal prison.

347
00:17:02,487 --> 00:17:05,585
(Gilbertson) So, Andrew.

348
00:17:05,757 --> 00:17:09,019
You wanna... you want to talk to me?

349
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:14,722
No?

350
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,710
Yes?

351
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,663
The truth is...

352
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:27,723
(Andrew clears throat)

353
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:32,384
Mr. Gilbertson, the truth is...

354
00:17:32,617 --> 00:17:34,308
Margaret and I...

355
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:39,043
...are just two people

356
00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:42,027
who weren't supposed to fall in love.

357
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:44,653
(Andrew) But did.

358
00:17:46,531 --> 00:17:48,669
We couldn't tell anyone we work with

359
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,288
because of my big promotion
that I had coming up.

360
00:17:51,436 --> 00:17:52,842
- (Gilbertson) Promotion?
- Yeah.

361
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:56,615
- Your...?
- We... we both felt, uh...

362
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:00,769
...that it would be deeply inappropriate
if I were to be promoted to editor.

363
00:18:00,978 --> 00:18:03,532
- Editor. Mmm-hmm.
...while we were...

364
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,605
So... (clears throat)

365
00:18:07,752 --> 00:18:10,687
Have the two of you told your parents
about your secret love?

366
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:14,053
Oh, I... impossible.
My parents are dead.

367
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,397
- No brothers or sisters either.
- Gone.

368
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,732
Are your parents dead?

369
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,937
- Oh, no, his are very much alive.
- No... very much.

370
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:24,230
Very much. They're, ah... Well,
we were gonna tell them this weekend.

371
00:18:24,402 --> 00:18:28,199
Gammy's 90th birthday, and the whole
family's coming together.

372
00:18:28,406 --> 00:18:29,932
And we thought it'd be a nice surprise.

373
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,983
(Gilbertson) And where is this
surprise gonna take place?

374
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,117
At Andrew's parents' house.

375
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:35,326
Where is that located again?

376
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,933
Um... (scoffs)
Why am I doing all the talking?

377
00:18:38,082 --> 00:18:39,392
Its your parents' house.

378
00:18:39,483 --> 00:18:40,858
Why don't you tell him
where it is. Jump in.

379
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,973
- Sitka.
- Sitka.

380
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,065
- Alaska.
- Alaska?

381
00:18:47,191 --> 00:18:49,199
You're gonna go to Alaska this weekend?

382
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,717
- Yeah.
- Yes, yes.

383
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,897
We are going to Alaska.
Alaska, thats where...

384
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:58,849
Thats where my little...
thats where my Andrew's from.

385
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:01,782
(Gilbertson) OK.

386
00:19:01,873 --> 00:19:05,190
Fine. I see how this is gonna go.

387
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:08,193
I will see you both
at 11:00 Monday morning

388
00:19:08,346 --> 00:19:10,233
for your scheduled interview,

389
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:13,610
and your answers better
match up on every account.

390
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,294
- Thank you.
- Hello?

391
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:18,396
- I'm looking forward to this one.
- We're looking forward to this one.

392
00:19:18,523 --> 00:19:19,537
Thank you.

393
00:19:19,623 --> 00:19:22,275
Gonna be fun.
I'll be checking up on you.

394
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:23,410
You got it.

395
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:32,691
OK... so, whats gonna happen is
we will go up there.

396
00:19:32,904 --> 00:19:34,847
We will pretend like we're
boyfriend and girlfriend,

397
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,499
tell your parents we're engaged.

398
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,135
Uh, use the miles for the tickets.

399
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:41,788
I guess I will pop for you to fly first
class. But make sure you use the miles.

400
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,257
If we don't get the miles,
we're not doing it.

401
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,203
Oh, and please confirm
the vegan meal, OK?

402
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,204
'Cause last time they actually
gave it to a vegan,

403
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,879
and they, uh... forced me to eat

404
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:51,377
this clammy, warm, creamy
salad thing, which was...

405
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,433
Hey, I'm... Why aren't you taking notes?

406
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:55,795
I'm sorry, were you not in that room?

407
00:19:55,927 --> 00:19:57,236
What? What?

408
00:19:58,663 --> 00:20:01,052
Oh! The thing you said about
being promoted?

409
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:03,108
Genius! Genius.
He completely fell for it.

410
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:04,446
I was serious.

411
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,319
I'm looking at a $250,000 fine
and five years in jail.

412
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:08,618
That changes things.

413
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:12,668
- Promote you to editor? No, no way.
- Then I quit, and you're screwed.

414
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:13,859
Bye-bye, Margaret.

415
00:20:13,944 --> 00:20:15,352
- Andrew!
- It really has been

416
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:18,708
- a little slice of heaven.
- Andrew, Andrew! Fine, fine.

417
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:22,039
I'll make you editor. Fine.

418
00:20:22,153 --> 00:20:25,601
If you do the Alaska weekend
and the immigration interview,

419
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,573
I will make you editor. Happy?

420
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,029
- And not in two years. Right away.
- Fine.

421
00:20:31,162 --> 00:20:32,592
And you'll publish my manuscript.

422
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:35,808
Ten thousand copy first...

423
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,394
Twenty thousand copies, first run.

424
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,357
And we'll tell my family
about our engagement

425
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:41,032
when I want and how I want.

426
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,343
Now, ask me nicely.

427
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:44,588
"Ask you nicely" what?

428
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:48,288
Ask me nicely to marry you, Margaret.

429
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:53,385
- What does that mean?
- You heard me. On your knee.

430
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:03,643
Fine.

431
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,585
(honking)

432
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:14,340
- Does this work for you?
- Oh, I like this. Yeah.

433
00:21:14,472 --> 00:21:16,545
- Will you marry me?
- No.

434
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,170
Say it like you mean it.

435
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,032
(clears throat)

436
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:24,128
- Andrew?
- Yes, Margaret?

437
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:27,249
- Sweet Andrew?
- I'm listening.

438
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,289
Would you please,
with cherries on top, marry me?

439
00:21:33,024 --> 00:21:35,577
OK. I don't appreciate the sarcasm,
but I'll do it.

440
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:38,247
- See you at the airport tomorrow.
- Good.

441
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:54,625
So, these are the questions
that INS is gonna ask us.

442
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,683
Now, the good news is is
I know everything about you,

443
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,475
but the bad news is
that you have four days

444
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:04,189
to learn all this about me.
So, you should... probably get studying.

445
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:10,130
You know all the answers
to these questions about me?

446
00:22:10,261 --> 00:22:12,204
- Scary, isn't it?
- (Margaret) A little bit.

447
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,631
- What am I allergic to?
- Pine nuts.

448
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:16,621
And the full spectrum of human emotion.

449
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:18,623
Oh, thats... that was funny.
(chuckles)

450
00:22:18,738 --> 00:22:20,462
- Mmm-hmm.
- Umm...

451
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:23,322
Here's a good one. Do I have any scars?

452
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,298
I'm pretty sure that you have a tattoo.

453
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:27,003
Oh, you're pretty sure?

454
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,381
I'm pretty sure. Two years ago,
your dermatologist called

455
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,368
and asked about a Q-switched laser.

456
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:32,978
I of course Googled a Q-switched laser

457
00:22:33,084 --> 00:22:35,288
and found that they
in fact do remove tattoos.

458
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,914
But you canceled your appointment.

459
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,050
So what is it? Tribal ink?

460
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,013
Japanese calligraphy? Barbed wire?

461
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:44,844
You know, its exciting for me
to experience you like this.

462
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:47,168
Thank you. You're gonna have
to tell me where it is, though.

463
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,705
- No, I'm not.
- They're gonna ask.

464
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:51,223
We're done with that question.
We're done with that question.

465
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,474
On to another question.
Let me see, let me see.

466
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:56,354
Oh, here's one. Whose place do we
stay at, yours or mine?

467
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:57,850
Thats easy. Mine.

468
00:22:57,942 --> 00:22:59,732
And why wouldn't we stay at mine?

469
00:22:59,844 --> 00:23:02,233
Because I live at Central Park West.

470
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,195
And you probably live at some
squalid little studio apartment

471
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:08,197
with stacks of yellowed
Penguin Classics.

472
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:11,201
(woman on PA) Ladies and gentlemen,
please fasten your seat belts.

473
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:13,844
We are beginning our descent
into Juneau.

474
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:15,650
Juneau? I thought
we were going to Sitka.

475
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:20,857
- We are.
- How are we getting to Sitka?

476
00:23:21,065 --> 00:23:23,072
- (rumbling)
- (rattling)

477
00:23:25,102 --> 00:23:26,150
Whoa.

478
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:53,328
All right. Here we go.

479
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,755
- Oh, there he is!
- Andrew!

480
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,936
- (woman shouting)
- (laughter)

481
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,302
Hi. Right this way...

482
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,671
- Hi!
- Oh...

483
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,271
- Its so good to see you!
- You're suffocating him, Grace.

484
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,242
- Come here.
- Hey, Gammy.

485
00:24:16,355 --> 00:24:19,005
Ah, Gammy. How are you doing?
Where's Dad?

486
00:24:19,156 --> 00:24:21,743
Oh, you know your father.
He's always working.

487
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:24,163
Never mind about him. Where's your girl?

488
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,662
Uh, she's... right there.

489
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,325
- (Gammy) Ah.
- (Andrew) There she is.

490
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:31,281
I guess the word "girl"
is inappropriate.

491
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:32,713
Annie.

492
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:34,854
- Hi!
- (Margaret) Hello.

493
00:24:34,939 --> 00:24:36,630
- Margaret, this is my mom.
- Oh, hello.

494
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:39,076
Yeah, great. This is my gammy, Annie.

495
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:42,177
- Pleasure.
- Well, hello there.

496
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:47,138
Now, do you prefer being called Margaret
or Satan's Mistress?

497
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:49,173
We've heard it both ways.

498
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:51,011
(Gammy) Actually we've heard it
lots of ways.

499
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:52,648
She's kidding.

500
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:55,125
- Oh! Oh... OK.
- (chuckling)

501
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:56,667
Thank you so much for...

502
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,386
allowing me to be a part
of this weekend.

503
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,563
Oh, you're welcome.
We're thrilled to have you.

504
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,391
Lets get you two back to the fort.

505
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:05,541
- OK.
- (Gammy) Oh...

506
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,572
- Its so good to see you.
- (grunts) There we are.

507
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:43,784
(Margaret whispers) Andrew...

508
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:47,191
(slightly louder) Andrew. Andrew!

509
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,701
(yelps) Please, don't do that.

510
00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:54,883
You didn't tell me about all
the family businesses, honey.

511
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:58,119
He was probably just
being modest, dear.

512
00:25:58,289 --> 00:25:59,718
Oh.

513
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:10,231
What are we doing? Shouldn't we
check into our hotel right now?

514
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,702
Oh, we canceled your reservation.

515
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:14,211
Family doesn't stay at a hotel.

516
00:26:14,305 --> 00:26:15,930
You're gonna stay in our home.

517
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,950
Oh, great! Great.

518
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,418
- What?
- (grunts) God.

519
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:21,616
You're gonna wanna use your legs
to lift that one.

520
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,463
Andrew! Help her with those.

521
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,006
I'd love to, but she won't let me
do anything.

522
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:30,501
She insists on doing it all herself.
She's one of those... she's a feminist.

523
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,653
(grunts)

524
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:41,042
Come on, sweetie.

525
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:45,054
(Gammy) You see the shoes
that broad was wearing?

526
00:26:54,712 --> 00:26:55,792
This is the last of 'em.

527
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:58,626
- Oh!
- Ooh.

528
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:01,749
- (Andrew) Five second rule.
- Got it!

529
00:27:01,918 --> 00:27:04,156
That will dry right off.

530
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,428
Psst! Psst!
I'm not getting on that boat.

531
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:08,346
You don't have to.
See you in a few days.

532
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,598
Psst! You know I can't swim.

533
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:13,119
Hence, the boat.

534
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:21,547
Come on.

535
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,998
(Andrew) Come on. Here we go.

536
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,918
Looking good, boss.
Take your time, though.

537
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,064
Shh.

538
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:46,966
She comes with a lot of baggage.

539
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:48,375
Just gonna give you
a little hand here.

540
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:53,215
Hand off ass! Off ass!

541
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:58,875
There you go. You're there.

542
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:07,144
Congratulations.
I'm a hundred years old now.

543
00:28:07,351 --> 00:28:09,555
(boat engine starting)

544
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:35,719
(Grace) Here we are. We're home.

545
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,124
That is your home?

546
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,559
Who are you people?

547
00:28:58,002 --> 00:28:59,464
(Margaret) Why did you tell me
you were poor?

548
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,287
- (Andrew) I never said I was poor.
- But you never told me you were rich.

549
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:04,545
I'm not rich. My parents are rich.

550
00:29:04,675 --> 00:29:07,009
OK, you know what?
Thats something only rich people say.

551
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:08,607
(woman) Hey, Andrew! Welcome home!

552
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:11,331
Hi! Mom, what is this?

553
00:29:11,482 --> 00:29:14,002
Nothing. Its just a little
welcoming party.

554
00:29:14,151 --> 00:29:15,330
Is that a crime?

555
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:17,460
Just 50 of our closest
friends and neighbors.

556
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,180
And all excited to meet you.

557
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,527
- Oh, good. Good.
- Come on. Come on.

558
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,863
- A party?
- Yeah, I guess so.

559
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:26,515
Come on. Lets go. My grandma's
moving faster than you.

560
00:29:28,232 --> 00:29:29,574
Put your back into it.

561
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:33,580
(* Michael Bublé:
I've Got You Under My Skin)

562
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:35,165
- (indistinct chatter)
- (laughter)

563
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,379
(woman) So nice to meet you,
Margaret. Welcome to Sitka.

564
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:39,418
Jill? Hi. Nice to meet you.
My pleasure.

565
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:42,578
Why didn't you tell me you were
some kind of Alaskan Kennedy?

566
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:43,761
How could I?

567
00:29:43,847 --> 00:29:47,197
We were in the middle of talking about
you for the last three years.

568
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:49,010
OK, know what? Timeout, OK?

569
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:50,778
This bickering Bickerson thing
has got to stop.

570
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,798
People need to think that we are
in love. So lets just...

571
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:54,386
That, thats no problem.
I can do that.

572
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:57,242
I can pretend to be the doting fiancé.
Thats easy.

573
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:58,803
But for you, its going to require

574
00:29:58,896 --> 00:30:01,198
that you stop snacking on
children while they dream.

575
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:03,917
Very funny. When are you going
to tell them we're engaged?

576
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:05,377
I'll pick the right moment.

577
00:30:05,468 --> 00:30:09,178
Hey, Andrew. Hi!

578
00:30:09,373 --> 00:30:11,892
Mrs. McKittrick. How are you?
Nice to see you.

579
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:13,953
Nice to see you, Mr. McKittrick.
This is Margaret.

580
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:15,867
- Hi. Pleasure.
- Margaret!

581
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,322
Hi, how are you? Pleasure.

582
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:20,676
So I always wanted to know,
what does a book editor do?

583
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,860
(man) Thats a great question, Louise.

584
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,289
I'm curious to know the answer myself.

585
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,149
- Hello, Dad.
- Son.

586
00:30:29,026 --> 00:30:30,488
This must be Maggie.

587
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:32,156
Uh, Margaret.

588
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:35,580
- Joe. Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure's mine.

589
00:30:35,766 --> 00:30:39,214
So why don't you tell us exactly
what a book editor does.

590
00:30:39,403 --> 00:30:42,719
Besides taking writers out
to lunch and getting bombed.

591
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:45,176
(Louise) Now that sounds like fun.

592
00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:47,033
No wonder you like being an editor.

593
00:30:47,144 --> 00:30:50,242
No, Louise. Andrew's not an editor,
he's an editor's assistant.

594
00:30:50,413 --> 00:30:52,803
Maggie here is the editor.

595
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,444
Margaret.

596
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:57,900
- So you're actually...
- Andrew's boss. Yeah.

597
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,649
Well. How about that.

598
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:01,066
(Louise) Huh.

599
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,068
I think I'll get a refill.

600
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:06,638
Charming.

601
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,435
Thats a hell of
a first impression, Dad.

602
00:31:13,604 --> 00:31:15,579
What the hell, Andrew?

603
00:31:15,706 --> 00:31:18,358
You show up here after all this
time with this woman you hated

604
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:19,786
- and now she's your girlfriend?
- We just got here.

605
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,121
Can we wait two seconds

606
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,585
before we throw the
kitchen sink at each other?

607
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,780
Just never figured you for a guy
who slept his way to the middle.

608
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:27,576
Actually, I'll have you know
that that woman in there

609
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:29,246
is one of the most
respected editors in town.

610
00:31:29,353 --> 00:31:30,401
She's your meal ticket,

611
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:31,895
and you brought her home
to meet your mother.

612
00:31:31,989 --> 00:31:36,179
She's not my meal ticket, Dad.
She's my fiancée.

613
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,850
- What'd you say?
- You heard me.

614
00:31:38,996 --> 00:31:40,719
I'm getting married.

615
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:46,190
- How are you?
- Good, good. Thank you.

616
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:47,580
Would you care for
some hors ïoeuvres?

617
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:48,916
No, I'm fine. Thank you very much.

618
00:31:49,006 --> 00:31:50,283
Its a tradition.

619
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:51,967
Its the texture. I'm not a fish person.

620
00:31:52,075 --> 00:31:54,378
- You'll like it.
- You're very sweet.

621
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:57,000
I think if you'll just taste it.

622
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:58,490
(muffled) Thank you so much.

623
00:32:02,386 --> 00:32:03,467
(Andrew) Ladies and gentlemen...

624
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:05,944
I have a very important
announcement to make.

625
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,617
Margaret and I are getting married.

626
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:08,935
Its the paprika.

627
00:32:09,026 --> 00:32:10,335
So sorry.

628
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,111
Thats OK. Its wash-and-wear.

629
00:32:15,065 --> 00:32:17,935
(Andrew) Yep. Honey? Where you at?

630
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:20,515
Here it is.

631
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:25,166
Come on down here, pumpkin.

632
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,000
- (Andrew) All right.
- OK.

633
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,566
Oh, look at her. Look at her.

634
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:30,827
(clapping)

635
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:33,249
Right there, ladies and
gentlemen. There she is.

636
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:35,719
(woman) Congratulations, Andrew.

637
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:36,836
Thank you.

638
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:38,709
Thank you very much.

639
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:41,279
- (woman) Time to celebrate.
- (woman #2) Get the champagne.

640
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:45,922
So that was your idea
of the perfect time

641
00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:47,175
- to tell them we're engaged?
- Mmm.

642
00:32:47,264 --> 00:32:48,857
'Cause it was brilliant.
Brilliant timing.

643
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,854
Andrew. Hi.

644
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:54,743
Gert? Oh, my God. Hey, hi. Wow.

645
00:32:54,938 --> 00:32:57,273
How you doing? I didn't know
that you were gonna be here.

646
00:32:57,409 --> 00:33:00,540
Your mom probably wanted it to
be a surprise. So... surprise.

647
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,100
- Right.
- And...

648
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:06,063
...we're being completely rude. Hi.

649
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:09,283
- (Andrew) Oh, God. This is my ex...
- Hi. I'm Gertrude.

650
00:33:09,453 --> 00:33:11,787
- Oh! Oh, wow. Wow!
- You can call me Gert.

651
00:33:11,922 --> 00:33:14,027
Well, congratulations, you guys.

652
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,533
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

653
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:17,087
So did I miss the story?

654
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:19,074
- What story?
- What story?

655
00:33:19,162 --> 00:33:20,854
About how you proposed.

656
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:25,121
Oh! How a man proposes says
a lot about his character.

657
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,310
- Yes.
- Yes, it does.

658
00:33:27,437 --> 00:33:29,959
I actually would love
to hear the story, Andrew.

659
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:31,188
Would you tell us?

660
00:33:31,277 --> 00:33:33,512
- (man) Yeah.
- (crowd murmurs) Yeah.

661
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:35,434
- (giggling)
- (Andrew) You know what?

662
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:39,377
Actually, Margaret loves
telling this story...

663
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,038
so I'm just gonna let her
go ahead and do that.

664
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,291
'Cause I think we
should just sit in rapture.

665
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:47,586
Huh! Wow, OK.

666
00:33:47,758 --> 00:33:51,436
Wow, where to begin... this story.

667
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,500
Well... um, wow.

668
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:56,639
Mmm... yeah.

669
00:33:56,766 --> 00:34:01,437
OK, well, um, Andrew and I...

670
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:04,323
Andrew and I were about to celebrate

671
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:06,963
- our first anniversary together.
- (all) Aw...

672
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:09,828
And I knew that he'd been
itching to ask me to marry him.

673
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:13,046
And he was scared.
Like a little tiny bird.

674
00:34:13,216 --> 00:34:15,519
So I started leaving him
little hints here and there...

675
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:18,304
...because I knew he wouldn't
have the guts to ask, but...

676
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:21,174
Thats not exactly how it happened.

677
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:22,755
- No? Hmm.
- No. No.

678
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:25,317
I mean, I picked up on
all her little hints.

679
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:27,405
This woman's about as subtle as a gun.

680
00:34:27,531 --> 00:34:29,669
- (all laugh)
- (Andrew) Yeah.

681
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,077
What I was worried about was

682
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:32,958
that she might find this little box...

683
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,972
Oh! The decoupage box that he made

684
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,213
where he'd taken the time to cut out

685
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:40,994
tiny, little pictures of himself. Yes.

686
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:44,691
Just pasted all over the
box. Oh! So beautiful.

687
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:47,217
So I opened that beautiful,
little decoupage

688
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:51,060
and out fluttered these tiny,
little hand-cut heart confettis.

689
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:55,183
And once they cleared,
I looked down, and I saw...

690
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:57,946
...the most beautiful, big...

691
00:34:58,095 --> 00:34:59,556
...fat nothing.

692
00:34:59,663 --> 00:35:00,973
No ring.

693
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:02,593
- No ring?
- What?

694
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:05,569
No. But inside that box...

695
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:07,329
...underneath all that crap...

696
00:35:07,437 --> 00:35:09,609
...there was a little
handwritten note...

697
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:13,123
with the address to
a hotel, date, and time.

698
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:14,936
Real Humphrey Bogart-type stuff.

699
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,354
(man) Yeah.

700
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:18,204
- Masculine.
- (grunts)

701
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:20,103
Anyway, naturally, Margaret thought...

702
00:35:20,216 --> 00:35:21,711
I thought he was seeing someone else.

703
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:23,859
- (crowd murmurs)
- It was a terrible time for me,

704
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:26,258
but I went to that hotel anyway.

705
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:28,397
I went there and I pounded on the door,

706
00:35:28,525 --> 00:35:30,282
but the door was already unlocked.

707
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:34,104
And as swung open that
door, there he was...

708
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,760
- Standing.
- Kneeling.

709
00:35:35,866 --> 00:35:37,360
- Like a man.
- On a bed of rose petals,

710
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,784
in a tuxedo. Your son. Your son.

711
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,386
And he was choking back
soft, soft sobs.

712
00:35:44,574 --> 00:35:47,707
And when he held back the tears
and finally caught his breath,

713
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:48,893
he said to me...

714
00:35:48,979 --> 00:35:49,994
"Margaret, will you marry me?"

715
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:53,276
And she said, "Yep."
The end. Who's hungry?

716
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:55,698
(crowd cooing)

717
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:58,340
That is quite a story.

718
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,311
- (Gammy) Oh, Andy!
- Gorgeous.

719
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:02,759
You are so sensitive.

720
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,530
Hand-cut confetti? (laughs)

721
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:09,414
Hey! Lets see a kiss
from you two cuties.

722
00:36:09,566 --> 00:36:10,614
(man) Give her a kiss!

723
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,677
- No. Come on.
- Oh, yeah.

724
00:36:12,804 --> 00:36:13,785
- Come on!
- (all cheering)

725
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:15,365
OK, all right.

726
00:36:15,472 --> 00:36:17,261
OK. Here we go. Ready?

727
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:23,067
What is this? Kiss her on
the mouth like you mean it.

728
00:36:23,279 --> 00:36:26,727
- Kiss her. Kiss her!
- (all chanting) Kiss her!

729
00:36:26,917 --> 00:36:30,658
Kiss her! Kiss her!
Kiss her! Kiss her!

730
00:36:30,854 --> 00:36:32,415
OK!

731
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:34,672
- OK. All right.
- OK.

732
00:36:34,758 --> 00:36:36,832
- Here we go.
- Mmm-hmm. OK.

733
00:36:38,628 --> 00:36:40,352
- Oh!
- (chuckles)

734
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:42,985
Andy! Give her a real kiss!

735
00:36:43,133 --> 00:36:45,686
- (chuckling) Gammy.
- A real one!

736
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:47,298
- (woman) Yeah.
- (woman #2) You can do it!

737
00:36:47,404 --> 00:36:48,997
Why don't we just do it?
Lets just do it really fast.

738
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:52,561
- (both) Mmmm.
- (cheering)

739
00:36:52,709 --> 00:36:55,524
- Mmm.
- Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

740
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:57,752
- (muffled) OK.
- Mmm.

741
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:07,637
Hmm.

742
00:37:09,425 --> 00:37:11,598
I'm so happy for you two!

743
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,959
So happy! So happy!

744
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:16,920
(woman) Lets get the champagne!

745
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:19,790
So here we are.

746
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:23,365
This is your bedroom.

747
00:37:24,674 --> 00:37:30,392
Wow. Wow, this is, um...
beautiful. And the view.

748
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:32,405
And here's the bed.

749
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:35,200
Wow! Exquisite bed. Exquisite.

750
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:38,200
So... where is Andrew's room?

751
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:40,210
Oh, sweetie, we're not
under any illusions

752
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:43,074
that you two don't
sleep in the same bed.

753
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:45,399
(laughing) He'll sleep
in here with you.

754
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:47,798
Oh, great, 'cause we love to snuggle.

755
00:37:47,931 --> 00:37:49,785
- Don't we, honey.
- We're huge snugglers.

756
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,039
- (barking)
- Oh, my God. What is it?

757
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:55,911
- Calm down, Kevin.
- Whoa! You are cute.

758
00:37:56,106 --> 00:37:57,632
Who is this?

759
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:01,189
- Thats Kevin. I'm sorry, Margaret.
- So cute.

760
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,353
We just rescued him from the pound,

761
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,390
and he's still in training. Sorry.

762
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:07,404
Just be sure you don't
let him outside,

763
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:09,242
or the eagles will snatch him.

764
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:11,141
No, don't you listen to her.

765
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:12,979
She's just pulling
your leg, isn't she?

766
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:16,287
By the way, there are extra
towels and linens and things

767
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:17,475
in here if you need them.

768
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:19,317
(Gammy) And if you
get chilly tonight...

769
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,023
...use this.

770
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,789
It has special powers.

771
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,769
Oh, what kind of special powers?

772
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:27,496
I call it the Baby Maker.

773
00:38:27,604 --> 00:38:29,612
OK, well. Then I guess we...

774
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:31,202
...gonna be super careful with that one.

775
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:33,348
- Yeah, I'm just gonna...
- Don't throw it on the bed.

776
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,364
We'd better turn in.
Its been quite an evening.

777
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,138
So good night, everybody.

778
00:38:37,247 --> 00:38:38,491
- Good night.
- Good night.

779
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:41,451
- Good night.
- Good night, Gammy.

780
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:44,713
- (chuckling) Good night.
- (Margaret) Good night.

781
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,433
- (Gammy) Good night.
- Good night, Gammy.

782
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,935
Thank you so much. Sweet dreams.

783
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:52,654
- Bye-bye, now.
- Bye.

784
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,714
(Margaret) So, uh... you haven't
been home in a while.

785
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:02,034
I haven't had a lot of vacation
time the last three years.

786
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:04,310
Stop complaining.

787
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:09,810
Um... Don't look, OK?

788
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,025
OK.

789
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:14,495
Are your eyes closed?

790
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:15,830
Completely.

791
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,148
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

792
00:39:27,931 --> 00:39:31,477
Those are the pajamas you
decided to bring to Alaska.

793
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:34,985
Yes, because I was supposed
to be in a hotel alone.

794
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:38,041
- Remember?
- Can we just go to sleep?

795
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:40,184
- Fine.
- Great.

796
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:50,588
(exhales, clears throat)

797
00:40:09,973 --> 00:40:12,078
Well. (clears throat)

798
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,419
Looks like I won't be
getting much sleep

799
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,931
with the sun streaming in.

800
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:23,847
Thank you.

801
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,858
(phone ringing)

802
00:40:45,175 --> 00:40:46,998
(Margaret) Andrew. Phone.

803
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,459
Andrew!

804
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,916
Crap. Andrew, Andrew, phone.

805
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,360
Andrew!

806
00:40:54,451 --> 00:40:56,306
Yeah... right.

807
00:41:00,023 --> 00:41:03,406
- Andrew, where is it?
- Purse, side pocket.

808
00:41:04,828 --> 00:41:07,031
- (thumping)
- (grunting)

809
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,013
Hello. Hello? Hello.

810
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:13,992
Frank! Frank, darling.

811
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:15,119
Darling, Frank.

812
00:41:15,205 --> 00:41:17,409
Are you there? Hello? Hello? Oh, crap.

813
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,858
I have horrible service, Frank.
Give me just one minute.

814
00:41:21,044 --> 00:41:22,735
Oh, my God! Margaret!

815
00:41:22,846 --> 00:41:25,301
(whispering) One... one minute.
Frank, hold on just a second.

816
00:41:25,448 --> 00:41:26,431
Frank, hold on. No, no, no, no.

817
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:27,565
(door shuts)

818
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:30,269
Frank. Frank, I'm sorry you feel

819
00:41:30,419 --> 00:41:32,973
I pressured you into doing Oprah, but...

820
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:36,440
Of course I want you
to be happy. Yes, yes.

821
00:41:36,628 --> 00:41:42,224
Frank. Frank. Frank, darling.
Frank? Its going to be fine.

822
00:41:42,499 --> 00:41:44,540
I can just call them and I can cancel.

823
00:41:46,035 --> 00:41:47,530
(panting)

824
00:41:49,274 --> 00:41:51,641
(Margaret) You are...
you are so right, Frank.

825
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:53,815
Yes, Frank, of course
I'm listening to you.

826
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:55,537
Yeah... yes.

827
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:57,173
I love listening to you, Frank.

828
00:41:57,282 --> 00:42:00,697
- (yapping)
- Shh! Sit. Sit.

829
00:42:02,185 --> 00:42:03,265
No, not you, Frank.

830
00:42:03,353 --> 00:42:05,077
- No, no.
- (barking)

831
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,846
Frank, if I may get down to it, OK...

832
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:10,339
I think it would be
a mistake to back out.

833
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,594
- Because, Frank, for so many years...
- (eagle screeching)

834
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:17,080
...you have inspired me with your
beautiful words, and I feel that...

835
00:42:17,267 --> 00:42:18,828
Shh! Dog, I'm on the phone.

836
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:21,718
I think its time that the world
get to enjoy your words as well.

837
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:23,334
They are just so rich

838
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,520
- with... passion...
- (dog barking)

839
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:29,081
And I think that we
should all be privy to.

840
00:42:29,314 --> 00:42:30,940
- Frank, I just, uh...
- (screeching)

841
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,575
I just, uh, want you
to be happy, Frank.

842
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:35,073
Give me that dog!

843
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,553
Frank, hold on a second.
Can you hold a second?

844
00:42:37,689 --> 00:42:38,671
Give me that dog!

845
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:41,886
Come on! Come on, come on, come on.

846
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:44,163
- Come on! Come on! Oh, oh...
- (squeaking)

847
00:42:44,294 --> 00:42:46,717
Oh, oh! Oh, oh. OK! OK, gotcha.

848
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,619
Frank, Frank.

849
00:42:48,731 --> 00:42:49,877
Frank? So sorry, so sorry.

850
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:52,967
So sorry. I dropped the phone.
Now, listen, Frank.

851
00:42:53,136 --> 00:42:55,754
I don't want to sell you on anything,

852
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,629
but this is your legacy, this book.

853
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,084
And I think its up to you to

854
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:00,158
present your legacy to the world.

855
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:03,309
And call me tomorrow with your decision.

856
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,138
And my phone is on
all the time! OK, bye-bye.

857
00:43:05,247 --> 00:43:06,230
No! Wait!

858
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:09,571
No! No! N-n-n... no. No

859
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:11,182
Take the doggy. Look at the doggy.

860
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:13,111
I need that phone. Take the dog.

861
00:43:13,224 --> 00:43:14,630
Take the dog. I need that phone!

862
00:43:14,726 --> 00:43:17,890
Here. Take the dog.
Take the dog. Take it. Take it.

863
00:43:18,061 --> 00:43:19,970
(Grace) Look at this.

864
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:21,243
(both laughing)

865
00:43:21,331 --> 00:43:23,949
- Is that cute or what?
- I know.

866
00:43:26,068 --> 00:43:28,687
Morning, guys. Have you seen... daah.

867
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:31,839
She's playing with Kevin.
We thought she didn't like him.

868
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:32,992
Will you go get her, Andy?

869
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:34,963
We have a whole day planned for her,

870
00:43:35,078 --> 00:43:36,934
and she needs to get ready.

871
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:39,218
Yeah. Tell her we have
a big surprise for her.

872
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,911
Mmm.

873
00:43:43,553 --> 00:43:46,400
Look! Give me my phone. Come on.
Please, just give me my phone.

874
00:43:46,556 --> 00:43:49,076
- Come on. Right here.
- What the hell are you doing?

875
00:43:49,227 --> 00:43:52,096
Oh, my God. Your grandmother
was completely right.

876
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:53,986
The eagle came
and tried to take the dog.

877
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:57,413
But then I saved him. Then it
came back, and it took my phone.

878
00:43:57,601 --> 00:43:59,870
- Are you drunk?
- What? No! I'm serious.

879
00:44:00,003 --> 00:44:02,371
He's got my phone, and Frank's
calling me on that phone.

880
00:44:02,507 --> 00:44:03,783
Relax, all right?

881
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:06,809
We'll order another phone, same number.
We'll go into town tomorrow and get it.

882
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:07,992
- Really?
- Yeah.

883
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:12,999
- Oh, OK. All right. Well, you go then.
- (barking)

884
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,007
- You have to get ready.
- For what?

885
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,493
You're going out with Mom and the girls.

886
00:44:16,586 --> 00:44:19,140
- I don't want to go out.
- Shopping, sightseeing. And a surprise.

887
00:44:19,291 --> 00:44:20,696
- I hate shopping.
- You'll love it.

888
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,198
- I hate sightseeing.
- You're going.

889
00:44:22,293 --> 00:44:23,503
- No, I don't want to go.
- You're going.

890
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,154
- I'm not going. I'm not going.
- Yes, you are.

891
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:26,669
Now give me a nice big hug.
We don't want them

892
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:27,843
- to think we're fighting.
- I don't want to touch you.

893
00:44:27,932 --> 00:44:29,655
- Come on. Hug time.
- No, I don't want to...

894
00:44:29,766 --> 00:44:31,425
- Hug time.
- I don't want to...

895
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:33,226
There we go.

896
00:44:33,336 --> 00:44:35,922
Yeah, thats nice.

897
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:38,659
Yeah. Thats nice.

898
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:41,264
There we go. Isn't that nice?

899
00:44:41,411 --> 00:44:42,873
- Mmm-hmm.
- (Andrew) Mmm-hmm.

900
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,386
- (Margaret) Mmm. Yeah.
- (Andrew) Boop boop boop.

901
00:44:44,482 --> 00:44:46,653
If you touch my ass one more time,

902
00:44:46,783 --> 00:44:48,855
I will cut your balls
off in your sleep. OK?

903
00:44:48,985 --> 00:44:50,740
- Yeah.
- There you go.

904
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,407
All righty now. So, uh...
We clear on that?

905
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:55,827
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Such a good fiancé.

906
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:57,682
Hmm. Ow.

907
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:07,329
(splashing)

908
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:14,306
- (Joe) Jeez.
- You want to see me?

909
00:45:14,477 --> 00:45:17,064
Your mom found these eco-balls.

910
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,003
They dissolve in water.

911
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:20,611
(grunts)

912
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,335
I don't know how she
comes up with this stuff.

913
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:27,284
Anyway, she, uh... is a little peeved.

914
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:31,320
Apparently, I wasn't the most
gracious of hosts last night.

915
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:32,772
It was a little bit of a shock

916
00:45:32,864 --> 00:45:34,359
to find out that
you're getting married...

917
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:37,563
...especially when none of us
even knew you were dating.

918
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:42,339
The point is... I owe you an apology.

919
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:46,247
Accepted.

920
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:48,994
There's something else.

921
00:45:49,147 --> 00:45:52,823
I've been going over my
retirement plans recently,

922
00:45:53,015 --> 00:45:54,477
and it got me thinking.

923
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,715
I've done a lot of things in my life.

924
00:45:57,821 --> 00:46:01,366
Practically built an empire with
your mother from the ground up.

925
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:02,671
It doesn't mean anything unless...

926
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,101
Unless you have someone to leave it to.

927
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:07,491
- We already discussed this.
- I'd like to discuss it again.

928
00:46:07,666 --> 00:46:11,440
You have responsibilities here.

929
00:46:11,636 --> 00:46:13,327
I think I've been
more than understanding

930
00:46:13,436 --> 00:46:14,778
about your goofing off in New York.

931
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:16,463
I need you to quit playing around...

932
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:17,588
Here we go again.

933
00:46:17,674 --> 00:46:19,879
When are you going to start
taking what I do seriously?

934
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:21,799
When you start acting seriously.

935
00:46:21,913 --> 00:46:24,280
I'm sorry.

936
00:46:24,413 --> 00:46:26,301
I feel sorry for you, Dad.

937
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:28,837
I wish you had another son. I really do.

938
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:30,099
One who wanted to stay here.

939
00:46:30,188 --> 00:46:31,878
One who wanted to take over
the family business.

940
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:33,963
One who wanted to marry someone
that you approve of,

941
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:37,287
but its not me. Now,
it must seem strange to you,

942
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:42,195
my life in New York... sitting
in an office, reading books.

943
00:46:42,433 --> 00:46:44,921
But it makes me happy. You understand?

944
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:51,522
If thats what makes you happy,
son, I got nothing to say.

945
00:46:51,709 --> 00:46:53,651
Well, thats a first.

946
00:46:53,778 --> 00:46:58,284
You know what? Apology not
accepted. Have fun out here.

947
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:03,234
(sniffs)

948
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:12,703
(indistinct chatter)

949
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:14,225
(Grace) There is no way you
could leave her at home.

950
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,023
She had to be here. Absolutely.

951
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:18,075
She's been coming here forever.

952
00:47:18,201 --> 00:47:20,852
I hope you are ready
for your big surprise...

953
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:24,168
...because this is one of
Sitka's greatest treasures.

954
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:26,513
- Right?
- Oh, yes. Oh, yeah.

957

I was telling you about. You ready?

- Wow.
- Over here, Ramone! Over here.

(Gammy) Over here, honey.

968

she's gonna be missing.

00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:34,719
Come, my sexy princess.

970
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:36,437
- Yeah!
- (Margaret) Oh, no. Not necessary.

971
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:39,296
Its a really nice gesture,
but I really need to just...

972
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:40,628
(Gammy) Go on, Margaret. Get up there!

973
00:48:40,718 --> 00:48:41,732
You come dance.

974
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:43,247

For you. For you. For you.

986
00:49:26,731 --> 00:49:29,513
- (Gert) Yeah!
- (Ramone) Enjoy!

987
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:37,605
I don't want to touch it.
No. OK, OK. Very sweet.

988
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:38,921
No, no, no, no, no.

989
00:49:41,344 --> 00:49:42,392
Smack him!

990

- Smack his ass.

Hey! There you are.
How are you holding up?

998

Oh, fine. Fine. Just working on my tan.

999

Yeah, the Paxtons can be
a bit overwhelming at times.

1000

Yes, yes.

1001
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:33,034
Its a little different
than New York, huh?

1002
00:50:33,164 --> 00:50:36,480
Little bit. Little bit. You ever been?

1003
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:39,536
No. That was always
Andrew's dream, not mine.

1004
00:50:39,702 --> 00:50:41,971
You guys were pretty serious, huh?

1005
00:50:42,104 --> 00:50:44,724
Well, I mean, we dated in high
school and all through college,

1006
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,881
but we were kids.

1007
00:50:48,778 --> 00:50:51,167
And you guys called it off because of...

1008
00:50:53,349 --> 00:50:55,585
Well, um...

1009
00:50:55,718 --> 00:51:00,191
the night before we graduated
school, he proposed...

1010
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:01,885
...and said he wanted to elope

1011
00:51:01,991 --> 00:51:04,642
and run away to New York with me.

1012
00:51:04,794 --> 00:51:07,249
And...

1013
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,186
You said "no."

1014
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:12,114
And I said "no," yeah.

1015
00:51:12,268 --> 00:51:16,044
I've never been anywhere
but here. This is home.

1016
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:20,843
But anyway... you're a lucky girl.

1017
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:26,096
He really is the best, which
you obviously already know.

1018
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:30,922
Oh, yep. Yep, very much so, yeah.

1019
00:51:31,156 --> 00:51:34,221

00:51:56,012 --> 00:52:00,039
- (Gammy giggling)
- He was wonderful.

1028
00:52:00,718 --> 00:52:01,928
Oh, no.

1029
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:07,135
(* Living Colour: Cult of
Personality through headphones)

1030
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,526
(Grace shouting) Andrew!

1031
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,831
Andrew, honey, is everything OK?

1032
00:52:15,431 --> 00:52:17,188
What... Whats he doing?

1033
00:52:17,302 --> 00:52:19,667
Something's up. Its best
to leave him alone.

1034
00:52:19,802 --> 00:52:21,013
Come on, honey.

1035
00:52:25,176 --> 00:52:27,116
(man on TV)... Hunts version
of that here tonight.

1036
00:52:27,243 --> 00:52:29,829
Hey, hey, hey. What are you
doing? I'm watching that.

1037
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,256
Why is Andrew out there

1038
00:52:31,347 --> 00:52:33,649
hollowing out that old
stupid canoe again?

1039
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:36,117
(Joe) Well, maybe he's
planning to escape. What?

1040
00:52:36,252 --> 00:52:37,976
I am so tired.

1041
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:39,844
Think I'm gonna go
upstairs, take a shower,

1042
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:42,061
wash off Ramone's coconut body oil.

1043
00:52:42,193 --> 00:52:43,501
Sure.

1044
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:45,830
I had a great day today. Thank you.

1045
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:49,180
What did you do?

1046
00:52:49,265 --> 00:52:51,404
I didn't do anything, I mean...

1047
00:52:51,534 --> 00:52:55,331
I just had a frank conversation
with him about his future.

1048
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:58,059
(Grace) Oh... Well, yeah.
Thats a good idea.

1049
00:52:58,208 --> 00:52:59,615
Thats a good idea, Joe,

1050
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:01,849
because he will never
come back home now.

1051
00:53:01,979 --> 00:53:05,426
He is my son. I only get
to see him every three years

1052
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:07,950
because of you. Because of you.

1053
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:09,099
- (barking)
- (Grace) I've had enough.

1054
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:11,552
- You are gonna be supportive...
- Shh!

1055
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:12,768
...of him marrying
Margaret, and that is that.

1056
00:53:12,854 --> 00:53:15,539
- Shh! Shh! Shh!
- (barking continues)

1057
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:17,187
You know, if we're not careful,

1058
00:53:17,293 --> 00:53:20,074
we are gonna end up in
this great big house...

1059
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:22,271
...just you and me alone...

1060
00:53:22,398 --> 00:53:24,056
...you and me and everything
that we're angry about,

1061
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:27,331
and God forbid that they
should have a grandchild

1062
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:29,129
that we never get to see.

1063
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:33,134
You are going to fix this,
Joe. I mean it. Fix it now.

1064
00:53:34,245 --> 00:53:36,154
(clears throat)

1065
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,026
(Margaret singing Relax)

1066
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:45,751
(groans) Where's a towel?

1067
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:50,776
(music playing through headphones)

1068
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:52,991
Towel...

1069
00:53:55,064 --> 00:53:58,097
Towel, towel, towel... towel, towel.

1070
00:53:58,267 --> 00:54:00,024
This is all they have for a towel?

1071
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:02,525
Its ridiculous. I can't get dry.

1072
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:04,713
(music on headphones continues)

1073
00:54:05,644 --> 00:54:06,657
Hello.

1074
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,459
Hello?

1075
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:16,662
Oh!

1076
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:20,451
- (barking)
- Oh! Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

1077
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:21,538
No, no, no, no, no.

1078
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:23,315
J-j-just... I'm sorry.

1079
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,499
L-l-let me just,
let me just get a towel.

1080
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:27,003
Let me just get a towel.

1081
00:54:27,096 --> 00:54:28,952
(moans) Just... look.

1082
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:30,657
You need to just... I'm sorry.

1083
00:54:30,766 --> 00:54:32,196
OK, I'm sorry for
feeding you to the eagle.

1084
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:33,709
- (barking)
- I'm sorry.

1085
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:38,179
(barking continues)

1086
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:39,520
Go away. Go away.

1087
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,781
Go, go. Just let me get a towel.

1088
00:54:41,912 --> 00:54:44,846
Go, go, go... Hold on.

1089
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:51,149
(hair dryer blowing)

1090
00:54:51,323 --> 00:54:52,947
Yeah. Huh?

1091
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:55,958
- (whimpering, barking)
- How you like that? Huh?

1092
00:54:56,125 --> 00:54:57,980
Take it, take it. Thats right.

1093
00:54:58,095 --> 00:55:00,614
Thats what I'm talking
about. You like that?

1094
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:05,450
Oh. You like it.

1095
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:07,544
(music continues)

1096
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:13,354
- Come here. Come to Mama.
- (barking)

1097
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:15,484
Thats right. Get on the carpet.

1098
00:55:15,611 --> 00:55:17,520
Thats a good boy.

1099
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:21,738
Yes! Thats good, boy! Come on.

1100
00:55:21,952 --> 00:55:23,544
Come on!

1101
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:25,115
- Oh, oh!
- (barking)

1102
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:28,652
(both gasp)

1103
00:55:28,759 --> 00:55:32,108
- Oh, oh!
- What the...?

1104
00:55:32,296 --> 00:55:34,717
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

1105
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:37,166
- Why are you naked? My God!
- Oh, God. Why are you wet?

1106
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,788
- Don't look at me.
- I don't understand.

1107
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:41,365
- (Andrew) Why are you wet?
- Why are you naked?

1108
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:43,065
Don't look at me.

1109
00:55:43,172 --> 00:55:45,660
Oh, God! You're showing everything.

1110
00:55:45,808 --> 00:55:47,717
Cover it up, for the love of God!

1111
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:51,936
(gasping) Oh, God, not the Baby Maker.

1112
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:53,611
Explain yourself please.

1113
00:55:53,717 --> 00:55:55,855
- Explain myself?
- Yes, explain yourself.

1114
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:57,098
- I was outside.
- Oh, really?

1115
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,358
- You didn't hear me?
- I was listening to...

1116
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:00,635
What are you even doing home?

1117
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:02,763
Then you just, jump me
out of nowhere? Whats that?

1118
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:04,551
I di... I didn't mean to jump you.

1119
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:08,785
Your dog was attacking me, and I
had to run, and I ran into you.

1120
00:56:08,999 --> 00:56:10,558
What is it with you and this dog?

1121
00:56:10,665 --> 00:56:12,576
Just, you know, just... go.

1122
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:13,947
- Go...
- Fine.

1123
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,563
- Go take a shower. You stink.
- Fine.

1124
00:56:15,671 --> 00:56:17,427
- Nice tattoo, by the way.
- What?

1125
00:56:18,342 --> 00:56:19,552
(barking)

1126
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:21,944
See? See? Exactly. You see that?

1127
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,567
Oh... barely made it out
with my life there.

1128
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,569
See the size of the teeth on that thing?

1129
00:56:26,682 --> 00:56:28,023
I didn't...

1130
00:56:29,485 --> 00:56:30,696
(groans)

1131
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:37,809
(Margaret clears throat)

1132
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:47,566
So... (exhales) So naked.

1133
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:49,243
(clears throat)

1134
00:56:49,338 --> 00:56:51,641
Can we, uh, not talk about that, please?

1135
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,371
Just sayin'.

1136
00:56:59,316 --> 00:57:01,771
So, uh, whats the deal
with you and your father?

1137
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:06,358
Ooh, I'm sorry. That question
is not in the binder. (clicks)

1138
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:08,858
Oh, really? Well, I thought
you were the one that said

1139
00:57:08,991 --> 00:57:10,268
we needed to learn all this...

1140
00:57:10,359 --> 00:57:11,853
Not about that, I didn't.

1141
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:13,783
- But if the guy asks us...
- Not about that, Margaret.

1142
00:57:13,896 --> 00:57:15,652
Good night.

1143
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:30,559
(sighs, clears throat)

1144
00:57:30,746 --> 00:57:34,969
- (Margaret) I like the Psychic Network.
- What?

1145
00:57:35,184 --> 00:57:37,835
Not in the "ha-ha, isn't that
funny, she likes that trash"

1146
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:40,923
kind of way. I actually quite enjoy it.

1147
00:57:41,091 --> 00:57:42,584
Umm...

1148
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:48,611
I took disco lessons in the sixth grade.

1149
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,762
My first concert was
Rob Base & D.J. E-Z Rock.

1150
00:57:57,174 --> 00:57:59,344
I think Brian Dennehy is sexy.

1151
00:58:00,878 --> 00:58:02,122
Don't like flowers in the house,

1152
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:05,375
'cause they remind me of funerals.

1153
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:07,009
Never played a video game.

1154
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:10,999
I read Wuthering Heights
every Christmas.

1155
00:58:11,153 --> 00:58:13,422
Its my favorite book.

1156
00:58:16,325 --> 00:58:20,602
Haven't slept with a man
in over a year and a half.

1157
00:58:22,766 --> 00:58:25,254
And, uh... I went to
the bathroom and cried

1158
00:58:25,402 --> 00:58:28,303
after Bob called me a poisonous bitch.

1159
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,789
And the, uh, bird tattoo?

1160
00:58:32,943 --> 00:58:34,285
They're swallows.

1161
00:58:36,912 --> 00:58:40,807
Got them when I was 16...
after my parents died.

1162
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:46,321
Stupid. (clears throat)

1163
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:48,496
I'm sure there's many many other things,

1164
00:58:48,624 --> 00:58:50,992
but thats all I can
come up with right now.

1165
00:58:58,234 --> 00:58:59,641
You, uh, there? (chuckles)

1166
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:03,916
I'm here.

1167
00:59:06,642 --> 00:59:08,333
Just processing.

1168
00:59:15,117 --> 00:59:17,321
You really haven't slept
with anyone in 18 months?

1169
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:19,843
Oh, my God. Out of all that,
thats all you got?

1170
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:21,397
Thats a long time.

1171
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:23,694
Yeah, well, I've been a little busy.

1172
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:25,866
Yeah...

1173
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:30,318
Who's, uh...

1174
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:33,434
- Rob Base and D. J...
- E-Z Rock?

1175
00:59:33,604 --> 00:59:35,295
- Yeah.
- You know.

1176
00:59:35,404 --> 00:59:36,714
(singing It Takes Two)

1177
00:59:42,212 --> 00:59:44,000
- No. They were good.
- Mm-mm.

1178
00:59:46,515 --> 00:59:47,693
(chuckles)

1179
00:59:47,783 --> 00:59:51,745
- What?
- Nothing.

1180
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:55,337
I know who they are. I just
wanted to hear you sing it.

1181
00:59:55,524 --> 00:59:57,696
(Andrew laughing)

1182
00:59:59,795 --> 01:00:00,810
(sighs)

1183
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:06,383
- Margaret?
- Yes?

1184
01:00:08,370 --> 01:00:10,738
Don't take this the wrong way.

1185
01:00:12,476 --> 01:00:15,127
(clears throat) 'K.

1186
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:20,099
You are a very... very beautiful woman.

1187
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:39,843
(laughing)

1188
01:00:45,842 --> 01:00:47,729
- Feel it deep, feel it low.
- Mmm-hmm.

1189
01:00:49,511 --> 01:00:52,098
God, I can't sing that high.

1190
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:54,904
(both laughing)

1191
01:01:07,931 --> 01:01:10,133
(birds chirping)

1192
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:17,433
Huh? Where am I?

1193
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:20,684
What time is it?

1194
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:22,271
- What time is it?
- (blinds sliding)

1195
01:01:22,378 --> 01:01:25,858
Ooh! Ooh. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh...

1196
01:01:39,161 --> 01:01:40,241
Oh, God.

1197
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:02,428
(knocking)

1198
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:06,162
(Grace) Room service.
Breakfast for the happy couple.

1199
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:08,776
- (whispers) Andrew! Andrew!
- (groaning)

1200
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:11,738
- Andr...
- (grunts)

1201
01:02:11,893 --> 01:02:13,300
Your mother's at the door. Get up!

1202
01:02:13,395 --> 01:02:14,705
- Get up here! Your mother's...
- Oh, God.

1203
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:16,323
(Margaret shouts) Just a second!

1204
01:02:20,769 --> 01:02:22,974
- Not the baby blanket.
- OK, all right.

1205
01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:25,724
Not the baby blanket. Get it
off, get it off, get it off.

1206
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:27,730
- OK, all right.
- Wait a second. Hold on.

1207
01:02:27,843 --> 01:02:29,730
- What? What?
- Are you wearing makeup?

1208
01:02:29,845 --> 01:02:31,504
What? No. Of course not.

1209
01:02:31,615 --> 01:02:34,550
- OK, what do we do? All right.
- Just spoon me, spoon me...

1210
01:02:34,718 --> 01:02:37,368
- Oh, my God! What is that?
- I'm sorry. Its morning.

1211
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,408
What do you mean, "Its morning"?

1212
01:02:39,523 --> 01:02:41,115
(Grace) Are you OK?

1213
01:02:41,223 --> 01:02:43,940
Yep! Coming. One second. Yep.
Come on in. Everything's fine.

1214
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:46,482
(whispers) Disgusting.

1215
01:02:46,629 --> 01:02:48,353
Ow, you're on my hair. OK, just...

1216
01:02:48,465 --> 01:02:53,450
(both panting)

1217
01:02:53,702 --> 01:02:56,867
- (Margaret) Oh, wow.
- (Andrew) Ooh, smells good.

1218
01:02:57,041 --> 01:02:58,381
Cinnamon rolls.

1219
01:02:58,473 --> 01:03:00,481
Oh, you shouldn't have
gone to that trouble.

1220
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:03,457
Oh, you're family now. Its no trouble.

1221
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,913
Hey, you have room for one more?

1222
01:03:06,048 --> 01:03:10,009
Wow. Could we not do the
Brady family meeting right now?

1223
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:11,202
We just got up...

1224
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:12,629
- Yeah.
...if you don't mind.

1225
01:03:12,722 --> 01:03:14,695
Your mother and I have
come up with a proposition

1226
01:03:14,823 --> 01:03:17,890
and I happen to think
its a terrific idea...

1227
01:03:18,061 --> 01:03:20,232
We want you
to get married here tomorrow.

1228
01:03:20,362 --> 01:03:21,442
Tomorrow.

1229
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:25,440
- What? What? What?
- Mmm-mmm. No.

1230
01:03:25,569 --> 01:03:27,162
Well, you're gonna get married anyway,

1231
01:03:27,269 --> 01:03:29,570
so why don't you get married here...

1232
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:31,046
...where we can be all together,

1233
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:34,305
and that way Grandma Annie
can be a part of it.

1234
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,548
- Oh. Oh, we're...
- No.

1235
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:39,875
No. No, its Gammy's
big birthday tomorrow night.

1236
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:41,097
Big day for her.

1237
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:43,192
We don't want to ruin it.
Thats you know...

1238
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:46,898
I've had 89 birthday parties,
I don't need another one.

1239
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:48,431
Oh, Gammy.

1240
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:50,892
It would be a dream come true for me

1241
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:53,295
to see my one grandchilïs wedding.

1242
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:55,601
- A dream come true!
- (Andrew) Mmmm.

1243
01:03:55,732 --> 01:03:58,798
- So you'll do it?
- (Andrew) Mmm-mmm.

1244
01:03:58,969 --> 01:04:00,560
Before I'm dead?

1245
01:04:00,669 --> 01:04:02,011
- OK. OK.
- OK.

1246
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:06,545
OK, we will do everything.

1247
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:09,130
And you can get married
like we did, in the barn.

1248
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:11,319
Its a Paxton family tradition.

1249
01:04:11,448 --> 01:04:14,033
- Oh, wow!
- Yup.

1250
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:19,268
Wow! Uh! I've always wanted to
get married in a... in a barn.

1251
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,758
- I have.
- Its a sign.

1252
01:04:21,892 --> 01:04:25,503
A sign from the universe that
you're meant to be together.

1253
01:04:25,694 --> 01:04:28,729
Oh, we must give thanks, I tell you.

1254
01:04:28,899 --> 01:04:31,898
Come, come. We must give thanks.

1255
01:04:32,067 --> 01:04:34,588
OK, I know I should leave you alone now.

1256
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:38,054
But we're just so excited!
I know you're excited, too.

1257
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,063
- Its the craziest.
- Really excited.

1258
01:04:40,175 --> 01:04:43,437
- (Andrew) Yeah! Go. Go.
- (Margaret laughing)

1259
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:44,660
Go.

1260
01:04:49,152 --> 01:04:52,348
Oh, my God.

1261
01:04:52,522 --> 01:04:54,343
When my mom finds out that
this whole thing is a sham

1262
01:04:54,455 --> 01:04:55,732
she's gonna... she's gonna be crushed,

1263
01:04:55,824 --> 01:04:57,930
and my grandmother's gonna die.

1264
01:04:58,061 --> 01:04:59,621
- Your mom's not going to find out.
- I... my father.

1265
01:04:59,728 --> 01:05:01,223
What the hell's with that?
The whole wedding thing?

1266
01:05:01,331 --> 01:05:02,312
Where did that come from?

1267
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:04,537
She probably got him worked up into it.

1268
01:05:04,668 --> 01:05:05,846
Its fine. She's not gonna find out.

1269
01:05:05,936 --> 01:05:07,976
- They're not going to find out.
- Oh, God. Margaret!

1270
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:11,420
Andrew, they're not gonna
find out, OK? Just relax.

1271
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:13,101
Its gonna be OK.

1272
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:15,598
Its not like we're
gonna be married forever.

1273
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:18,232
We'll be happily divorced
before you know it.

1274
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:22,604
It will be fine. It will be fine.

1275
01:05:22,819 --> 01:05:24,313
You OK?

1276
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:25,980
Yeah.

1277
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:32,994
- Get us some coffee.
- Yeah.

1278
01:05:33,161 --> 01:05:36,707
So, would you like a cinnamon soy latte?

1279
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,558
- A-ha.
- (Margaret chuckles)

1280
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:44,767
(Andrew) You're right, you know...

1281
01:05:44,873 --> 01:05:46,117
Get a quickie divorce, we'll be fine.

1282
01:05:46,209 --> 01:05:47,769
- Absolutely.
- Its gonna be fine.

1283
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:50,146
Everything is going to be great.

1284
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:52,101
But this little missus
better learn how to cook...

1285
01:05:52,214 --> 01:05:53,970
...so she can take care of her husband.

1286
01:05:54,084 --> 01:05:55,164
Keep my man happy.

1287
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:56,908
I don't want him leaving
me for another woman.

1288
01:05:57,019 --> 01:05:58,066
- (both laugh)
- Come on...

1289
01:05:58,153 --> 01:06:00,804
...haven't left you yet, Margaret.

1290
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:03,706
I got it. Let go.

1291
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:08,063
- You all right?
- Yeah, um...

1292
01:06:08,198 --> 01:06:09,626
You know what? I'm gonna go.

1293
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:10,976
Where?

1294
01:06:11,066 --> 01:06:13,848
I just kinda feel like going outside.

1295
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:16,425
All right. Thats the bathroom.

1296
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:17,914
Oh, yeah. I know. I'm just, uh...

1297
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:21,072
I'm gonna go to go to the bathroom,
and then I'm gonna go out, outside.

1298
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:22,225
All right.

1299
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:24,786
(exhales) All right.

1300
01:06:35,824 --> 01:06:40,494
OK, you just have to focus,
Margaret. Just focus.

1301
01:06:40,729 --> 01:06:43,379
This is a business deal.
This is just a business deal.

1302
01:06:43,532 --> 01:06:48,104
(clears throat) Everything's
gonna be just fine.

1303
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:53,348
OK, this is a little
rough. I can do this.

1304
01:06:54,977 --> 01:06:57,344
Oh, my God. God, I hate nature!

1305
01:06:57,479 --> 01:06:58,755
I hate it.

1306
01:06:58,847 --> 01:07:02,110
Not stopping. Not stopping. Oh! Oh...

1307
01:07:02,285 --> 01:07:04,172
Why are you not stopping?

1308
01:07:04,287 --> 01:07:06,621
(growls) Stop, stop, stop it, stop!

1309
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:08,413
(panting)

1310
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:13,327
I just wanted... some air.

1311
01:07:13,495 --> 01:07:17,587
(drum beating)

1312
01:07:17,801 --> 01:07:20,189
- What is that?
- (flute begins to play)

1313
01:07:20,334 --> 01:07:24,808
What now? What is that? What is that?

1314
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:27,375
- (drum and flute continue)
- What is that?

1315
01:07:35,851 --> 01:07:39,974
(woman chanting in foreign language)

1316
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:42,262
- (chanting continues)
- (Margaret) What is that?

1317
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:48,271
(chanting continues)

1318
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:01,773
(woman) Come to me,
Margaret of New York.

1319
01:08:01,944 --> 01:08:04,312
It is I, Grandma Annie.

1320
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:05,755
Oh!

1321
01:08:05,849 --> 01:08:08,238
(Gammy) I see you are a curious one.

1322
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:11,253
Come. See how I give
thanks to Mother Earth.

1323
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,722
You know, actually,
I'm not that curious.

1324
01:08:13,857 --> 01:08:15,645
- I'll just...
- Look around you.

1325
01:08:15,757 --> 01:08:18,179
Mother Earth has provided all this...

1326
01:08:18,327 --> 01:08:22,582
...just as she brought you and
Andrew together to be joined.

1327
01:08:22,797 --> 01:08:25,319
- Oh.
- We must give thanks

1328
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:28,534
and ask that your loins
be abundantly fertile.

1329
01:08:28,705 --> 01:08:32,020
Come. Dance with me in celebration.

1330
01:08:32,207 --> 01:08:35,404
You know, can I, can I
just thank her from here?

1331
01:08:35,577 --> 01:08:37,366
I insist!

1332
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:39,683
OK, OK, OK.

1333
01:08:39,815 --> 01:08:42,466
I will come down and dance with you.

1334
01:08:44,419 --> 01:08:47,452
Follow and learn.

1335
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:51,235
(chants in foreign language)

1336
01:08:51,426 --> 01:08:55,386
Come on, Margaret! Feel the
rhythm of the drums. Now you.

1337
01:08:55,596 --> 01:08:57,059
- Me what?
- Chant.

1338
01:08:57,167 --> 01:08:58,661
Chant what?

1339
01:08:58,768 --> 01:09:00,806
(stammers) Whatever comes
to you. It is the way.

1340
01:09:00,936 --> 01:09:04,548
- But I don't know any chants.
- To the trees. Use your vowels.

1341
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:08,351
- Eee. Ooo. Ooo. Eee.
- Ooo. Eee.

1342
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:10,235
- Yes. Chant.
- Yes. Chant, chant.

1343
01:09:10,346 --> 01:09:12,385
- Eee. To the trees.
- Yes! Yes!

1344
01:09:12,514 --> 01:09:16,376
- (shouts) To the universe!
- The universe. Ah. Universe.

1345
01:09:16,584 --> 01:09:20,196
To the crazy.
To the window, the window.

1346
01:09:20,389 --> 01:09:21,982
To the wall, to the wall.

1347
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:23,716
To the sweat drip down my balls.

1348
01:09:23,825 --> 01:09:26,159
- To all you bitches...
- Louder!

1349
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:28,149
To the window, to the window.

1350
01:09:28,263 --> 01:09:29,922
To the walls, to the walls.

1351
01:09:30,033 --> 01:09:31,559
To the sweat drip down my balls.

1352
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:33,839
Now all you bitches crawl.

01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:35,563

01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:37,198

01:09:55,724 --> 01:09:58,658
(hooting)

1366
01:09:58,828 --> 01:10:01,545
Gammy! Lets take it
to the bridge! Woo!

1367
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:03,769
* Let me see you get low
You scared, you scared

1368
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:05,808
* Drop your ass to the flo'
You scared, you scared

1369
01:10:05,934 --> 01:10:07,429
* Let me see you get low
You scared, you scared

1370
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:08,966
- * Drop your ass to the floor
- You scared!

1371
01:10:09,072 --> 01:10:10,477
* You scared, you scared
See you get low

1372
01:10:10,572 --> 01:10:11,979
- * You scared, you scared
- You scared.

1373
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:13,928
* Your butt to the flo'
You scared, you scared

1374
01:10:14,042 --> 01:10:15,733
* Now stop, woo
Now wiggle it

1375
01:10:15,845 --> 01:10:17,754
* Now stop, woo
Jiggle it, just jiggle it

1376
01:10:17,879 --> 01:10:19,951
- Whatcha doing?
- * Just wiggle it

1377
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:22,156
Oh, uh.

1378
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:26,375
Uh... You know,
your Gammy wanted me to...

1379
01:10:26,587 --> 01:10:28,410
...you know, chant.
Chant from the heart.

1380
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:30,913
Balls? Thats what came to your heart?

1381
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:34,637
You know, it went with the beat.

1382
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:36,521
Your phone arrived.

1383
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:38,127
I'm gonna go into town
to pick it up. Wanna come?

1384
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:41,016
Oh, yes, I want to go.
I want to go. Oh, hold on.

1385
01:10:41,169 --> 01:10:43,951
Is it, uh, OK if I go with him?

1386
01:10:44,106 --> 01:10:46,627
Whatever you do is what shall be.

1387
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:48,855
But you're OK if I go?

1388
01:10:48,943 --> 01:10:52,260
- Fine. Go on.
- Bye, Gammy.

1389
01:10:52,447 --> 01:10:54,837
- You're a freak!
- Shut up.

1390
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:57,350
- (Andrew laughing)
- Would you, please?

1391
01:10:58,020 --> 01:10:59,002
Ow!

1392
01:11:16,039 --> 01:11:17,151
(bell jingles)

1393
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:18,287
Hey, buddy.

1394
01:11:18,373 --> 01:11:20,031
Andrew, hey!

1395
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:22,990
- You got that phone I ordered?
- Yes, it came in. How are you?

1396
01:11:23,146 --> 01:11:24,967
- Great. You?
- (Ramone) Good.

1397
01:11:26,948 --> 01:11:28,378
Hola.

1398
01:11:29,318 --> 01:11:31,774
Hey, hi.

1399
01:11:31,921 --> 01:11:33,481
Remember this?
(sings Relax)

1400
01:11:33,588 --> 01:11:34,635
Yes, yes.

1401
01:11:34,722 --> 01:11:37,177
Wonderful. Wonderful. Yes.

1402
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:40,174
- Remember that?
- Yes. Yes. I know.

1403
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:45,407
Think you made quite
an impression on Ramone.

1404
01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:47,804
Mmm-hmm, I think the part
where I burst into tears

1405
01:11:47,937 --> 01:11:49,497
just really brought us together.

1406
01:11:49,604 --> 01:11:51,010
- Yeah. Oh, guess what.
- What?

1407
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:52,481
Fun fact about Andrew number 11:

1408
01:11:52,574 --> 01:11:54,035
- I like Pringles.
- Mm-hmm. OK.

1409
01:11:54,142 --> 01:11:55,451
They're delicious. All Hostess products.

1410
01:11:55,545 --> 01:11:57,138
Coke, never Pepsi, and beef jerky.

1411
01:11:57,247 --> 01:11:58,455
What, are you, like, 13?

1412
01:11:58,547 --> 01:12:00,074
- Mmm.
- Here we go.

1413
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:01,361
Its all charged up, Andrew.

1414
01:12:01,451 --> 01:12:02,432
Thanks, buddy.

1415
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:06,555
And I put your lady's number in, too.

1416
01:12:06,687 --> 01:12:08,117
- Thank you very mu...
- Milady.

1417
01:12:08,223 --> 01:12:11,354
- (squeaks)
- (chuckles)

1418
01:12:11,527 --> 01:12:13,436
Thank you, thank you very much.
Thank you.

1419
01:12:13,562 --> 01:12:14,871
Just... thank you.

1420
01:12:14,963 --> 01:12:18,957
(bell jingling)

1421
01:12:19,167 --> 01:12:21,655
Oh, my God. I have 37 messages.

1422
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:24,080
Shit. I need a computer.

1423
01:12:24,172 --> 01:12:25,929
Is there, is there a computer
in this godforsaken town?

1424
01:12:26,876 --> 01:12:28,086
(bell jingling)

1425
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:32,710
OK. So when it runs out,
it gives you a warning.

1426
01:12:32,882 --> 01:12:34,158
Just put in more dimes.

1427
01:12:35,617 --> 01:12:37,373
- Here you go.
- What?

1428
01:12:37,487 --> 01:12:39,341
- (Margaret) You're kidding. Dimes?
- (Gert) Come on, Kels.

1429
01:12:39,454 --> 01:12:40,861
- (Margaret) You're not kidding?
- (Andrew) I'll be outside.

1430
01:12:40,957 --> 01:12:42,234
- Yell if you need me.
- But what am I supposed...

1431
01:12:42,325 --> 01:12:43,918
(Andrew) You'll be fine.

1432
01:12:44,024 --> 01:12:45,967
(* Niall Toner Band:
Lonely Souls and Broken Hearts)

1433
01:12:46,094 --> 01:12:49,956
OK, I can figure this out.
I'm an intelligent woman.

1434
01:12:50,166 --> 01:12:52,499
Block 'em out, block 'em out,
block 'em out. There you go.

1435
01:12:52,633 --> 01:12:54,260
OK. (clears throat)

1436
01:12:54,369 --> 01:12:56,507
- Now.
- (modem beeping, dialing)

1437
01:12:56,638 --> 01:12:58,067
What is that? What is it?

1438
01:12:58,173 --> 01:13:00,245
(tone sounding)

1439
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:04,712
(Margaret) Um, uh, excuse me? Excuse...

1440
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:08,402
(sighs)

1441
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:09,630
OK.

1442
01:13:12,522 --> 01:13:14,463
OK. (clears throat)

1443
01:13:15,957 --> 01:13:16,939
(exhales deeply)

1444
01:13:42,317 --> 01:13:44,871
(Margaret) So, it was nice
to see Gertrude, huh?

1445
01:13:45,021 --> 01:13:46,426
Yeah.

1446
01:13:46,521 --> 01:13:48,627
She looked really pretty today.

1447
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:51,914
- Yeah, she did.
- Mmm-hmm.

1448
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:56,131
Must be nice to see each other
again and just catch up.

1449
01:13:56,298 --> 01:13:58,338
Its definitely good to see her. Its...

1450
01:13:58,467 --> 01:14:00,223
...definitely, yeah.
Its been a long time.

1451
01:14:02,103 --> 01:14:04,470
Oh, there they are.
There they are. Margaret!

1452
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:05,883
- (Gammy) Woo!
- (both laughing)

1453
01:14:05,975 --> 01:14:07,022
(Grace) We need Margaret.

1454
01:14:07,108 --> 01:14:09,563
Afraid we're going to have to
steal you away, young lady.

1455
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:11,172
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm just gonna keep...

1456
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:12,905
No, not to worry.

1457
01:14:13,014 --> 01:14:15,250
No strippers, no chanting
in the woods. Promise.

1458
01:14:15,383 --> 01:14:17,171
- Oh, well...
- Yeah. Come on.

1459
01:14:17,285 --> 01:14:20,962
But not you. Its girl stuff.
You'd hate it.

1460
01:14:21,156 --> 01:14:23,611
- But...
- Come on.

1461
01:14:23,759 --> 01:14:25,285
Um, OK. Will I, uh...

1462
01:14:25,393 --> 01:14:27,532
...are these shoes OK
for what we're gonna do?

1463
01:14:28,997 --> 01:14:30,852
I can't believe this is happening.

1464
01:14:31,999 --> 01:14:34,455
My mother made this dress by hand.

1465
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:38,215
In this very shop. In 1929.

1466
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:41,275
Its funny how things
come back in style.

1467
01:14:41,443 --> 01:14:43,353
(Margaret) Just... just
finishing up the buttons.

1468
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,137
Yeah, and don't worry about the fit

1469
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:48,148
because Annie is the best
tailor in southeast Alaska.

1470
01:14:48,315 --> 01:14:49,298
Oh... Pssh.

1471
01:14:51,754 --> 01:14:53,215
Wow, incredible.

1472
01:14:53,321 --> 01:14:55,776
Maybe a tad loose in certain
areas, but otherwise...

1473
01:14:55,925 --> 01:14:59,503
Oh, sorry. I'm a bit
chesty to begin with

1474
01:14:59,694 --> 01:15:02,280
and I happened to be
knocked up when I wore this.

1475
01:15:02,430 --> 01:15:03,706
- Oh.
- (chuckling)

1476
01:15:03,799 --> 01:15:06,963
Oh, lets see if we can find your boobs.

1477
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:12,138
- They're in there somewhere.
- Yes. Yes, they are.

1478
01:15:12,307 --> 01:15:14,063
This is like an Easter egg hunt.

1479
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:17,699
Maybe they shrunk up
in the cold Alaskan air.

1480
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:20,628
(all laughing)

1481
01:15:20,783 --> 01:15:24,526
- Oh! There they are.
- That... yes. That would be...

1482
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:28,102
- (Gammy) There, lets see.
- I was thinking, if you'd like,

1483
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:32,830
maybe we could head down your
way for the holidays this year.

1484
01:15:33,062 --> 01:15:35,166
Oh, that would, uh...
that would be nice.

1485
01:15:35,297 --> 01:15:39,607
That'd be nice. Or maybe
we could come to you, too.

1486
01:15:39,834 --> 01:15:43,412
- Well, that would be lovely.
- Mmm-hmm.

1487
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:45,678
I would like that very much.

1488
01:15:45,808 --> 01:15:48,491
Oh, Grace, for Goïs sake.
We've got work to do.

1489
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:51,326
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Go make yourself a cup of tea.

1490
01:15:51,478 --> 01:15:54,196
I'll finish this. Go.

1491
01:15:54,350 --> 01:16:00,045
Now, lets make this
absolute perfection.

1492
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:02,363
(Gammy chuckling)

1493
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:07,760
Now, just one special touch
and you're ready.

1494
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:16,338
Its been in the family
for more than 150 years.

1495
01:16:16,571 --> 01:16:18,459
Annie, its beautiful,
but I don't really think...

1496
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:21,126
- Shh. I'm not finished.
- Oh, sorry.

1497
01:16:21,276 --> 01:16:24,626
My great-grandfather gave it
to my great-grandmother

1498
01:16:24,814 --> 01:16:26,887
when they got married.

1499
01:16:27,016 --> 01:16:28,990
They were quite a scandal, you know.

1500
01:16:29,117 --> 01:16:32,914
He was Russian and she
was Tlingit, and back then

1501
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:35,805
you had to get approval
from every member of the tribe

1502
01:16:35,957 --> 01:16:37,233
before you got married.

1503
01:16:37,325 --> 01:16:38,819
Almost broke them up.

1504
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:41,742
Well... how did they stay together then?

1505
01:16:41,897 --> 01:16:44,481
She was a lot like you. Tough.

1506
01:16:44,633 --> 01:16:47,449
Wouldn't take "no" for an answer.

1507
01:16:47,602 --> 01:16:51,311
She was good for him.

1508
01:16:51,506 --> 01:16:53,196
I want you to have it.

1509
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:56,658
- I can't. Can't take this.
- I don't want to hear it.

1510
01:16:56,846 --> 01:17:00,326
Grandmothers love to give
their stuff to their grandchildren.

1511
01:17:00,516 --> 01:17:03,134
It makes us feel like we'll
still be part of your lives

1512
01:17:03,284 --> 01:17:04,627
even after we're gone.

1513
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,824
Take it.

1514
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:12,140
(clears throat)

1515
01:17:12,228 --> 01:17:15,456
Are... are you all right, dear?

1516
01:17:16,931 --> 01:17:19,484
(exhales deeply) I, uh...

1517
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:23,951
Uh... Well, I, um...

1518
01:17:26,241 --> 01:17:31,740
I, uh... I just, uh, I just wanted to...

1519
01:17:32,013 --> 01:17:34,663
make sure there was enough time
to get all the sewing done.

1520
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:37,663
(chuckles) Don't you worry about that.

1521
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:40,186
- You're gonna be beautiful.
- OK.

1522
01:17:40,321 --> 01:17:43,769
- Now lets get you out of those pins.
- OK.

1523
01:18:01,676 --> 01:18:03,432
(footsteps approaching)

1524
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:08,127
All right.

1525
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:17,510
This is untied. Hop on in.

1526
01:18:17,726 --> 01:18:18,709
(grunting)

1527
01:18:20,061 --> 01:18:22,363
Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1528
01:18:23,165 --> 01:18:24,506
Whoa! What...

1529
01:18:24,598 --> 01:18:26,093
Mind telling me what the hell's wrong?

1530
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:27,827
I just needed to get
away from everybody.

1531
01:18:27,937 --> 01:18:29,878
- Whats wrong?
- Nothing! Just stop talking, please!

1532
01:18:38,414 --> 01:18:41,829
Would you mind telling me
whats happening now?

1533
01:18:42,016 --> 01:18:43,423
Margaret.

1534
01:18:46,121 --> 01:18:48,543
- Margaret!
- I forgot, OK?

1535
01:18:48,691 --> 01:18:49,835
(Andrew) You forgot what?

1536
01:18:49,924 --> 01:18:52,380
I forgot what it was
like to have a family!

1537
01:18:52,528 --> 01:18:54,796
I've been on my own since I was 16

1538
01:18:54,928 --> 01:18:57,743
and I forgot what it felt
like to have people love you

1539
01:18:57,899 --> 01:19:00,071
and make you breakfast and say, "Hey!

1540
01:19:00,201 --> 01:19:01,728
We'd love to come down
for the holidays."

1541
01:19:01,835 --> 01:19:05,185
And I say, "Well, why don't we
come up and see you instead?"

1542
01:19:05,373 --> 01:19:07,762
And give you necklaces!
And you have all that here,

1543
01:19:07,909 --> 01:19:10,461
and you have Gertrude, and
I'm... I'm just screwing it up!

1544
01:19:10,612 --> 01:19:12,751
You're not screwing it up!
I agreed to this!

1545
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:13,896
You were there, remember?

1546
01:19:13,983 --> 01:19:15,476
Your family loves you. Do you know that?

1547
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:17,078
- I know that! Yes!
- You know that?

1548
01:19:17,186 --> 01:19:18,777
And you're still willing
to put them through this?

1549
01:19:18,887 --> 01:19:19,869
They're not gonna find out!

1550
01:19:19,954 --> 01:19:21,199
How do you know they won't find out?

1551
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:22,566
Because you said so yourself.

1552
01:19:22,657 --> 01:19:24,546
- I know, but what if your mother...
- You said so yourself!

1553
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:25,805
Oh, my God, if your mother found out...

1554
01:19:25,894 --> 01:19:27,836
Whoa! Whoa!

1555
01:19:27,962 --> 01:19:29,523
- Oh, my God! What if Gammy finds out?
- The boat is moving!

1556
01:19:29,631 --> 01:19:31,005
If Gammy finds out, she's
gonna have a heart attack!

1557
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:32,954
Stop! Its gonna be fine!

1558
01:19:33,067 --> 01:19:35,205
- She's gonna have a heart attack!
- Will you calm down! Hold on!

1559
01:19:36,237 --> 01:19:37,699
(Andrew) Whoa, whoa. Whoa!

1560
01:19:37,807 --> 01:19:41,287
Whoa! I don't think
that hijacking a boat

1561
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:44,924
is a proper way to
express your frustration!

1562
01:19:45,113 --> 01:19:46,423
Now... Oh, great.

1563
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:48,750
Now you decide to shut up! Margaret?

1564
01:19:48,882 --> 01:19:50,858
- (Margaret) Andrew!
- Margaret?

1565
01:19:50,986 --> 01:19:53,539
- (gasping) Andrew!
- Margaret!

1566
01:19:57,458 --> 01:19:58,473
I can't swim!

1567
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,022
Margaret!

1568
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:01,338
(Andrew) To the buoy!

1569
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:03,797
- What?
- To the buoy!

1570
01:20:04,799 --> 01:20:05,781
OK.

1571
01:20:12,472 --> 01:20:14,644
(gasping)

1572
01:20:19,113 --> 01:20:21,382
All right, come on! Give me your hand!

1573
01:20:21,516 --> 01:20:23,884
- Hey! Give me your hand!
- (gasping)

1574
01:20:24,019 --> 01:20:26,603
Margaret! Give me...

1575
01:20:26,753 --> 01:20:28,216
Come on, give me your hand!

1576
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:29,752
Come on, come on. I got you. I got you.

1577
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:32,289
I got you. (grunting)

1578
01:20:33,596 --> 01:20:35,897
- (Margaret gasping, shuddering)
- Come on.

1579
01:20:36,031 --> 01:20:37,786
(grunts) What the hell
were you thinking?

1580
01:20:37,899 --> 01:20:39,492
Coulïve gotten yourself killed.

1581
01:20:39,602 --> 01:20:42,863
You turned the boat and
made me fall in, you jackass.

1582
01:20:43,037 --> 01:20:44,980
You let go of the steering wheel, Ahab.

1583
01:20:45,107 --> 01:20:47,627
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1584
01:20:47,776 --> 01:20:50,939
All right, come here.
You've got to get warm. Come on.

1585
01:20:51,112 --> 01:20:55,488
Come on. Its OK. (panting)

1586
01:20:55,717 --> 01:20:56,830
Thats OK.

1587
01:21:00,289 --> 01:21:01,467
Its OK.

1588
01:21:33,588 --> 01:21:35,018
I want to talk to both of you.

1589
01:21:48,169 --> 01:21:50,690
Your mother is never to
hear about any of this.

1590
01:22:03,117 --> 01:22:05,026
Told you I'd check up on you.

1591
01:22:06,622 --> 01:22:07,799
What did you do?

1592
01:22:07,889 --> 01:22:09,711
I got a phone call from
Mr. Gilbertson here,

1593
01:22:09,824 --> 01:22:11,996
who told me that if you were lying,

1594
01:22:12,127 --> 01:22:14,266
and he strongly believes that you are,

1595
01:22:14,396 --> 01:22:15,857
he would send you to prison.

1596
01:22:15,964 --> 01:22:17,971
So I flew him up here.

1597
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:20,041
- Dad.
- Luckily for you,

1598
01:22:20,169 --> 01:22:23,070
your father negotiated
a deal on your behalf.

1599
01:22:23,237 --> 01:22:26,336
(Gilbertson) Now, this offer's
gonna last for 20 seconds,

1600
01:22:26,507 --> 01:22:28,166
so listen closely.

1601
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:29,324
You're gonna make a statement

1602
01:22:29,411 --> 01:22:31,003
admitting this marriage is a sham...

1603
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:32,357
...or you're gonna go to prison.

1604
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:34,585
You tell the truth, you're off the hook,

1605
01:22:34,716 --> 01:22:37,368
and she is going to go back to Canada.

1606
01:22:42,890 --> 01:22:45,573
Ah, well. Take the deal.

1607
01:22:45,728 --> 01:22:49,951
- I don't think so.
- Don't be stupid, Andrew.

1608
01:22:50,165 --> 01:22:51,888
You want a statement?
Here's your statement.

1609
01:22:52,001 --> 01:22:53,594
I've been working for
Margaret Tate for three years.

1610
01:22:53,701 --> 01:22:55,905
Six months ago we started
dating, we fell in love.

1611
01:22:56,037 --> 01:22:57,826
I asked her to marry me, she said "yes."

1612
01:22:57,940 --> 01:23:00,045
I'll see you at the wedding.

1613
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:12,345
Well, you know.

1614
01:23:33,741 --> 01:23:37,538
So...

1615
01:23:37,745 --> 01:23:40,297
...you sure about this?

1616
01:23:40,447 --> 01:23:41,942
Not really.

1617
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:48,436
I mean, I am very appreciative
of what you've done,

1618
01:23:48,589 --> 01:23:49,571
but I think that...

1619
01:23:49,656 --> 01:23:50,802
You'd do the same for me.

1620
01:23:50,892 --> 01:23:52,453
Right?

1621
01:23:53,929 --> 01:23:56,165
- (knocking)
- Hope everyone is decent.

1622
01:23:56,298 --> 01:23:57,726
You need to come with me.

1623
01:23:57,833 --> 01:23:59,459
(Gammy) Now, tomorrow
is your wedding day.

1624
01:23:59,568 --> 01:24:01,161
You have to give the
Baby Maker a rest tonight.

1625
01:24:01,269 --> 01:24:02,959
Its tradition.

1626
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:04,980
- Give your bride a kiss good night.
- We're not gonna...

1627
01:24:05,106 --> 01:24:06,284
...use the Baby Maker.

1628
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:08,033
(Gammy) You've got your whole
lives to be together.

1629
01:24:08,143 --> 01:24:10,825
- (Andrew) OK.
- Now, come on. Come on.

1630
01:24:16,685 --> 01:24:18,145
(sighs)

1631
01:24:18,251 --> 01:24:19,397
If I don't go with her,
she's just gonna...

1632
01:24:19,487 --> 01:24:23,230
- Come right back.
- Yeah.

1633
01:24:30,364 --> 01:24:31,674
See you in the morning?

1634
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:34,142
Yeah.

1635
01:24:46,948 --> 01:24:49,817
(indistinct chatter from TV)

1636
01:25:32,727 --> 01:25:34,036
(crowd chattering)

1637
01:25:37,231 --> 01:25:38,279
Hey, Gammy.

1638
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:41,825
- Thanks, Gammy.
- Oh.

1639
01:25:47,441 --> 01:25:49,896
(* Pachelbel: Canon in D plays)

1640
01:26:50,138 --> 01:26:51,479
(music ends)

1641
01:26:51,572 --> 01:26:53,000
(Ramone) Everyone, please be seated.

1642
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:00,028
Ramone.

1643
01:27:01,014 --> 01:27:02,324
(speaks Spanish)

1644
01:27:04,017 --> 01:27:08,556
We are gathered here
today to give thanks...

1645
01:27:09,724 --> 01:27:12,244
...and to celebrate...

1646
01:27:12,393 --> 01:27:14,849
...one of life's greatest moments.

1647
01:27:14,997 --> 01:27:16,751
(Ramone) To give recognition

1648
01:27:16,864 --> 01:27:21,436
to the beauty, honesty,
and unselfish ways

1649
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:24,353
of Andrew and Margarets true love

1650
01:27:24,504 --> 01:27:26,872
in front of family and friends.

1651
01:27:27,009 --> 01:27:29,791
For it is their family and friends

1652
01:27:29,945 --> 01:27:34,068
who taught Andrew and Margaret to love.

1653
01:27:34,282 --> 01:27:38,854
So it is only right that
family and friends are all...

1654
01:27:42,556 --> 01:27:44,696
Mi amor. Do you have a question?

1655
01:27:45,627 --> 01:27:47,514
Uh, no...

1656
01:27:47,628 --> 01:27:49,058
Your hand is up.

1657
01:27:52,701 --> 01:27:55,603
Oh, it, its, uh, not a question,

1658
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:57,941
but I do have something I need to say.

1659
01:27:58,072 --> 01:28:01,846
- Margaret.
- Can it wait till after?

1660
01:28:02,042 --> 01:28:06,385
Uh... No. No.

1661
01:28:16,525 --> 01:28:17,866
(sighs)

1662
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:21,701
- (clears throat) Hi there.
- (all murmur) Hi.

1663
01:28:21,897 --> 01:28:23,969
Thank you all so much for coming out.

1664
01:28:24,098 --> 01:28:27,131
(Margaret) I, uh... have
a bit of an announcement

1665
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:29,341
to make about the wedding.

1666
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:32,633
- A confession, actually.
- What are you doing?

1667
01:28:32,807 --> 01:28:36,222
Uh... I'm a Canadian. Yes, Canadian.

1668
01:28:36,410 --> 01:28:40,403
With an expired visa
who was about to be deported.

1669
01:28:40,614 --> 01:28:42,207
And because I didn't want to leave

1670
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:44,455
this wonderful country of yours,

1671
01:28:44,585 --> 01:28:47,401
I forced Andrew here to marry me.

1672
01:28:47,557 --> 01:28:48,930
Margaret, stop it.

1673
01:28:49,023 --> 01:28:52,733
See, Andrew has always had
this extraordinary work ethic.

1674
01:28:54,362 --> 01:28:55,954
Something I think he learned from you.

1675
01:28:57,331 --> 01:28:59,306
And for three years I
watched him work harder

1676
01:28:59,433 --> 01:29:01,321
than anyone else at our company.

1677
01:29:01,435 --> 01:29:04,566
And I knew that if I threatened
to destroy his career...

1678
01:29:04,739 --> 01:29:07,806
...he would, he would do
just about anything.

1679
01:29:11,512 --> 01:29:15,374
So I blackmailed him to
come up here and to lie to you.

1680
01:29:17,685 --> 01:29:20,587
(Margaret) All of you.

1681
01:29:20,756 --> 01:29:23,374
And I thought it would
be easy to watch him do it.

1682
01:29:23,525 --> 01:29:25,499
(clears throat)

1683
01:29:25,627 --> 01:29:27,120
But it wasn't.

1684
01:29:30,064 --> 01:29:32,138
Turns out its not easy
to ruin someone's life

1685
01:29:32,267 --> 01:29:34,786
once you find out
how wonderful they are.

1686
01:29:36,370 --> 01:29:37,832
(crowd murmurs)

1687
01:29:41,144 --> 01:29:43,084
You have a beautiful family.

1688
01:29:45,012 --> 01:29:47,052
(Margaret) Don't let this
come between you.

1689
01:29:50,183 --> 01:29:52,388
This was my fault.

1690
01:29:52,521 --> 01:29:54,276
Margaret...

1691
01:29:54,388 --> 01:29:56,211
Andrew, this was a business deal,

1692
01:29:56,324 --> 01:30:00,186
and you held up your end,
but now the deal is off.

1693
01:30:01,630 --> 01:30:02,873
I'm sorry.

1694
01:30:04,833 --> 01:30:06,010
And, you, meet me at the dock.

1695
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:07,823
You're giving me a ride to the airport.

1696
01:30:13,607 --> 01:30:15,516
(crowd chattering)

1697
01:30:21,849 --> 01:30:22,832
(chuckles)

1698
01:30:24,718 --> 01:30:27,108
- What were you thinking?
- I don't, I don't know.

1699
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:28,780
Andrew, you lied to us.

1700
01:30:28,889 --> 01:30:30,231
Let me get my head on straight, OK?

1701
01:30:30,324 --> 01:30:31,666
I'll explain everything later.

1702
01:30:31,759 --> 01:30:33,996
I'm sorry.

1703
01:31:11,499 --> 01:31:14,249
(Margaret) You were right.
This book is special.

1704
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:15,961
I lied because I knew publishing meant

1705
01:31:16,071 --> 01:31:17,280
I'd lose you as an assistant

1706
01:31:17,371 --> 01:31:19,510
but... you have an extraordinary eye,

1707
01:31:19,641 --> 01:31:22,542
and I'll make sure we
buy this before I leave.

1708
01:31:22,710 --> 01:31:26,671
Have an amazing life.
You deserve it. Margaret.

1709
01:31:29,084 --> 01:31:32,182
Well, that was, uh... crazy.

1710
01:31:32,353 --> 01:31:33,630
(snorts)

1711
01:31:33,722 --> 01:31:36,056
You know, people are gonna be
talking about this forever.

1712
01:31:38,058 --> 01:31:39,619
Yeah. Yeah.

1713
01:31:41,396 --> 01:31:42,475
Are you OK?

1714
01:31:43,765 --> 01:31:46,513
Yeah. No. Uh...

1715
01:31:48,802 --> 01:31:52,512
I just feel... You know
what the problem is?

1716
01:31:52,707 --> 01:31:55,772
The problem is that this woman...

1717
01:31:55,943 --> 01:31:59,326
...is a gigantic pain in my ass.

1718
01:31:59,513 --> 01:32:01,880
First there's the whole leaving
thing. I understand that.

1719
01:32:02,017 --> 01:32:04,700
Its a sham wedding.
Its kind of stressful.

1720
01:32:04,853 --> 01:32:07,755
But then she goes ahead
and she leaves this note.

1721
01:32:07,923 --> 01:32:09,711
Because she doesn't have the decency...

1722
01:32:09,824 --> 01:32:11,863
the humanity to do it to my face.

1723
01:32:11,992 --> 01:32:16,880
Three years. Three years
I work with this... this terrorist.

1724
01:32:17,131 --> 01:32:18,658
Never once has she had
a nice thing to say,

1725
01:32:18,766 --> 01:32:20,555
and then she goes ahead
and she writes this crap!

1726
01:32:20,668 --> 01:32:22,360
- Andrew.
- But none of that matters

1727
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:23,647
because we had a deal!

1728
01:32:23,738 --> 01:32:27,763
- Andrew.
- Sorry. I'm sorry. I just...

1729
01:32:27,974 --> 01:32:29,120
She just makes me a little crazy.

1730
01:32:29,209 --> 01:32:32,504
(Gert chuckles) Yeah. I can see that.

1731
01:32:32,679 --> 01:32:36,575
So you're just gonna let her go?

1732
01:32:50,030 --> 01:32:51,918
So, what now?

1733
01:32:52,033 --> 01:32:54,879
(Gilbertson) Well... now that
you're leaving voluntarily,

1734
01:32:55,035 --> 01:32:57,620
it all becomes very civilized.

1735
01:32:57,770 --> 01:33:00,422
Once we land in New York,
you have 24 hours

1736
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:03,476
to head back to Canada.

1737
01:33:10,985 --> 01:33:13,222
- Andrew, whats happening?
- I got to talk to her.

1738
01:33:13,355 --> 01:33:14,532
- Why would you do that?
- Boys!

1739
01:33:14,622 --> 01:33:15,605
This has nothing to do with you.

1740
01:33:15,690 --> 01:33:16,672
Boys, stop it! Stop it!

1741
01:33:16,758 --> 01:33:18,186
(Joe) I'm not gonna let you do this.

1742
01:33:18,291 --> 01:33:19,699
(Andrew) I'm not asking
your permission here.

1743
01:33:19,793 --> 01:33:22,859
- (gasps)
- Annie! Joe! Joe!

1744
01:33:23,031 --> 01:33:26,096
Annie! Joe!

1745
01:33:26,265 --> 01:33:29,136
I think I'm having a heart attack.

1746
01:33:29,304 --> 01:33:30,678
- Easy. Easy.
- Somebody get a doctor!

1747
01:33:30,771 --> 01:33:32,528
- Easy, easy.
- (man) Get a doctor!

1748
01:33:36,645 --> 01:33:37,692
I got it.

1749
01:34:06,274 --> 01:34:07,931
Andrew.

1750
01:34:10,578 --> 01:34:13,839
You two need to stop fighting.

1751
01:34:14,014 --> 01:34:16,567
(Gammy) You'll never see eye to eye.

1752
01:34:17,986 --> 01:34:21,466
But you're family.

1753
01:34:24,958 --> 01:34:29,692
Promise me you'll stand by Andrew.

1754
01:34:29,930 --> 01:34:32,679
Even if... if you don't agree with him.

1755
01:34:35,169 --> 01:34:36,479
I promise.

1756
01:34:38,472 --> 01:34:40,806
Andrew.

1757
01:34:40,941 --> 01:34:46,658
Promise me you'll work harder
to be a part of this family.

1758
01:34:46,948 --> 01:34:48,891
I will.

1759
01:34:51,618 --> 01:34:53,854
(Andrew) I will, Gammy.

1760
01:34:53,987 --> 01:34:59,388
Well, then, the spirits can take me.

1761
01:34:59,661 --> 01:35:01,352
Oh, Annie.

1762
01:35:08,168 --> 01:35:09,762
Gammy?

1763
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:17,969
I guess they're not ready for me.

1764
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:21,036
I'm feeling much better, sonny.

1765
01:35:21,148 --> 01:35:22,970
(Gammy) No need to take us
to the hospital.

1766
01:35:23,082 --> 01:35:24,806
Take us to the airport, please.

1767
01:35:24,919 --> 01:35:26,674
Mom, what? Are you faking
the heart attack?

1768
01:35:26,787 --> 01:35:28,162
- Oh, come on!
- (laughing)

1769
01:35:28,255 --> 01:35:30,011
Well, it was the only
way I could get you two

1770
01:35:30,124 --> 01:35:32,426
to shut up and get us to the airport!

1771
01:35:32,559 --> 01:35:34,535
(man) Ma'am, we're not authorized
to take you to the airport.

1772
01:35:34,662 --> 01:35:37,509
Larry Ferris, don't
make me call your mother.

1773
01:35:37,664 --> 01:35:39,736
(Larry) You got it.

1774
01:35:41,401 --> 01:35:43,605
(sighs) You scared the hell out of me.

1775
01:35:48,810 --> 01:35:52,704
Yep. You shoulïve
given up back in New York.

1776
01:35:52,913 --> 01:35:56,012
See, I'm like Eliot Ness.

1777
01:35:56,183 --> 01:35:59,151
I always get my man.

1778
01:35:59,321 --> 01:36:02,222
I'm that good.

1779
01:36:02,389 --> 01:36:04,429
Flight 1601, as soon
as you're in position,

1780
01:36:04,558 --> 01:36:05,802
you're cleared for takeoff.

1781
01:36:05,894 --> 01:36:06,974
(man on radio) Roger that, Chuck.

1782
01:36:15,069 --> 01:36:16,890
OK. Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1783
01:36:20,141 --> 01:36:23,010
- (phone ringing)
- (chuckles)

1784
01:36:23,177 --> 01:36:24,671
Tower. Talk to me.

1785
01:36:24,778 --> 01:36:26,786
- Chuck! Its Drew Paxton.
- Hey, dude.

1786
01:36:26,914 --> 01:36:29,784
Hey, uh... I have a little
favor I need from you, buddy...

1787
01:36:29,951 --> 01:36:31,925
Margarets on that plane. I got
to talk to her. Can you stop it?

1788
01:36:32,052 --> 01:36:33,296
(Chuck) Oh, yeah!

1789
01:36:33,387 --> 01:36:35,079
I heard about your lady bailin'.

1790
01:36:35,189 --> 01:36:38,091
- Drag-ola. (laughs)
- (Andrew) Chuck! I need you

1791
01:36:38,257 --> 01:36:39,720
to stop the plane. Please.

1792
01:36:39,828 --> 01:36:42,577
I can't do that. (laughing)

1793
01:36:42,729 --> 01:36:45,925
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no! Come on!

1794
01:36:46,867 --> 01:36:48,209
Oh, no.

1795
01:36:50,437 --> 01:36:52,063
No!

1796
01:36:53,906 --> 01:36:55,729
- Whats wrong?
- Margarets on that plane.

1797
01:36:55,843 --> 01:36:58,014
- And he didn't get to tell her.
- Tell her what?

1798
01:36:58,145 --> 01:36:59,552
That he loves her.

1799
01:36:59,647 --> 01:37:02,363
So she could tell him
that she loves him, too.

1800
01:37:02,515 --> 01:37:03,628
OK, but how does he...

1801
01:37:03,718 --> 01:37:05,027
If she didn't love him,
she wouldn't have left.

1802
01:37:05,119 --> 01:37:06,547
Of course not.

1803
01:37:06,653 --> 01:37:08,115
Am I the only one not getting this?

1804
01:37:08,223 --> 01:37:11,932
- Oh, Joe!
- Chuck! Chuck! Look down.

1805
01:37:12,125 --> 01:37:13,533
Oh! Oh. Look down.

1806
01:37:13,628 --> 01:37:15,832
(Chuck)
Like... Oh, there you are!

1807
01:37:15,963 --> 01:37:18,003
Sorry, man. There was
nothing I could do.

1808
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:21,694
Thanks, Chuck.

1809
01:37:24,838 --> 01:37:28,930
I'm sorry, son. I didn't
know how you felt about her.

1810
01:37:34,314 --> 01:37:35,840
(Grace) Honey, its gonna be OK.

1811
01:37:54,568 --> 01:37:56,323
(phone ringing)

1812
01:38:09,384 --> 01:38:10,790
Jordan?

1813
01:38:24,699 --> 01:38:26,159
(clears throat)

1814
01:38:29,169 --> 01:38:30,151
Jordan.

1815
01:38:31,572 --> 01:38:32,979
Jordan!

1816
01:38:33,074 --> 01:38:36,269
I need for you to send
the boxes in my office to...

1817
01:38:36,443 --> 01:38:37,969
...to this address, please.

1818
01:38:38,078 --> 01:38:42,234
This one right here.
This address right here. OK?

1819
01:38:42,449 --> 01:38:44,905
- Can you do that?
- Uh, yes. Sure.

1820
01:38:45,052 --> 01:38:46,841
- Good, all right. Thank you.
- Miss Tate.

1821
01:38:46,954 --> 01:38:50,019
Yes. What? What?

1822
01:38:52,025 --> 01:38:55,254
(panting) Hey.

1823
01:38:56,764 --> 01:38:59,283
Andrew.

1824
01:39:03,203 --> 01:39:05,723
Why are, why are you panting?

1825
01:39:05,873 --> 01:39:07,945
Because I've been running.

1826
01:39:08,075 --> 01:39:10,793
- Really. From Alaska?
- I need to talk to you.

1827
01:39:10,944 --> 01:39:12,569
Yeah? Well, I don't have time to talk.

1828
01:39:12,678 --> 01:39:14,980
I need to catch a 5:45 to Toronto.

1829
01:39:15,114 --> 01:39:16,741
- Margaret.
- I need the boxes to go out today.

1830
01:39:16,850 --> 01:39:17,865
I want to make sure everything is...

1831
01:39:17,952 --> 01:39:19,959
Margaret! Stop talking!

1832
01:39:21,989 --> 01:39:24,029
(all gasp)

1833
01:39:24,157 --> 01:39:25,587
(Andrew) Gotta say something.

1834
01:39:25,693 --> 01:39:27,319
- (whispering) OK.
- This will just take a sec.

1835
01:39:27,428 --> 01:39:29,249
Fine. What?

1836
01:39:30,331 --> 01:39:34,870
Three days ago, I loathed you.

1837
01:39:35,103 --> 01:39:37,207
I used to dream about you
getting hit by a cab.

1838
01:39:37,337 --> 01:39:38,581
Or poisoned.

1839
01:39:38,673 --> 01:39:42,121
- Oh, thats nice.
- I told you to stop talking.

1840
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:44,797
Then we had our little
adventure up in Alaska

1841
01:39:44,945 --> 01:39:47,215
and things started to change.

1842
01:39:47,348 --> 01:39:49,900
Things changed when we kissed.

1843
01:39:51,985 --> 01:39:53,840
And when you told me about your tattoo.

1844
01:39:56,558 --> 01:39:58,661
Even when you checked me
out when we were naked.

1845
01:39:58,792 --> 01:40:00,101
- (all murmuring)
- (woman) Uh-huuuh.

1846
01:40:00,194 --> 01:40:01,273
Naked?

1847
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:03,248
Well, I didn't see anything...

1848
01:40:03,364 --> 01:40:04,674
(Andrew) Yeah, you did.

1849
01:40:04,766 --> 01:40:08,857
But I didn't realize any of
this until I was standing alone.

1850
01:40:09,069 --> 01:40:12,714
In a barn... wife-less.

1851
01:40:12,908 --> 01:40:15,427
Now, you can imagine my disappointment

1852
01:40:15,575 --> 01:40:16,983
when it suddenly dawned on me

1853
01:40:17,078 --> 01:40:21,203
that the woman I love is about
to be kicked out of the country.

1854
01:40:23,985 --> 01:40:25,740
So, Margaret.

1855
01:40:28,055 --> 01:40:29,136
Marry me.

1856
01:40:32,627 --> 01:40:35,016
Because I'd like to date you.

1857
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:50,537
Trust me. You don't really
want to be with me.

1858
01:40:50,710 --> 01:40:52,369
Yes, I do.

1859
01:40:54,081 --> 01:40:56,951
See, the thing is, there is a reason why

1860
01:40:57,117 --> 01:40:59,605
I've been alone all this time.

1861
01:40:59,753 --> 01:41:01,640
I'm comfortable that way.

1862
01:41:01,755 --> 01:41:03,697
And I think it would
just be a lot easier

1863
01:41:03,824 --> 01:41:09,607
if we forgot everything
that happened and I just left.

1864
01:41:11,731 --> 01:41:13,258
You're right.

1865
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:21,328
That would be easier.

1866
01:41:37,224 --> 01:41:40,540
- I'm scared.
- Me, too.

1867
01:41:44,098 --> 01:41:46,138
(crowd murmurs)

1868
01:42:04,552 --> 01:42:07,366
Aren't you supposed to get down
on your knee or something?

1869
01:42:07,522 --> 01:42:08,984
I'm gonna take that as a "yes."

1870
01:42:09,090 --> 01:42:11,031
Oh, OK.

1871
01:42:14,161 --> 01:42:16,104
(crowd chattering)

1872
01:42:25,639 --> 01:42:28,454
(man) Yeah! Show her
who's boss, Andrew!

1873
01:42:28,609 --> 01:42:30,267
(laughter)

1874
01:42:31,545 --> 01:42:33,455
(clapping)

1875
01:42:36,684 --> 01:42:40,164
(Gilbertson) So, let me see
if I've got this right.

1876
01:42:40,354 --> 01:42:42,688
You two are engaged again.

1877
01:42:42,822 --> 01:42:44,316
- (Andrew) Yes.
- (Margaret) Yes.

1878
01:42:44,424 --> 01:42:46,432
For real?

1879
01:42:47,460 --> 01:42:48,572
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1880
01:42:48,662 --> 01:42:49,677
You're sure you want to
go through with this?

1881
01:42:49,764 --> 01:42:50,844
Because one wrong answer...

1882
01:42:50,932 --> 01:42:53,998
I'm gonna take you down.

1883
01:42:56,503 --> 01:42:59,089
- OK.
- OK.

1884
01:43:00,841 --> 01:43:02,085
Lets do it.

1885
01:43:11,585 --> 01:43:13,046
(Gilbertson) When did you
first start to date?

1886
01:43:13,153 --> 01:43:14,942
Last week.

1887
01:43:15,055 --> 01:43:18,154
- (Gilbertson) That going well?
- So far its great. Thank you.

1888
01:43:18,326 --> 01:43:19,754
(Gilbertson) What kind of
deodorant does Andrew use?

1889
01:43:19,859 --> 01:43:21,353
Men's Speed Stick?

1890
01:43:21,461 --> 01:43:24,625
(Gilbertson) What flavor? Musk? Alpine?

1891
01:43:24,798 --> 01:43:26,042
Was it love at first sight?

1892
01:43:26,133 --> 01:43:28,172
(inhales) No.

1893
01:43:28,302 --> 01:43:31,979
I loved her from the beginning.

1894
01:43:32,173 --> 01:43:33,383
(Gilbertson) What side of the
bed does Margaret sleep on?

1895
01:43:33,473 --> 01:43:35,131
She sleeps on the left.

1896
01:43:35,242 --> 01:43:36,616
What side of the bed do you sleep on?

1897
01:43:38,713 --> 01:43:42,869
Look, are they soul mates? Eeeh.

1898
01:43:43,083 --> 01:43:45,603
Uh... Will they kill each other? No.

1899
01:43:45,752 --> 01:43:46,832
(Gilbertson) Are you a good driver?

1900
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:49,408
Oh, excellent driver. Excellent.

1901
01:43:49,556 --> 01:43:53,102
(makes crashing,
screaming, siren sounds)

1902
01:43:53,294 --> 01:43:55,595
Oh.

1903
01:43:55,730 --> 01:43:58,598
In my mind I see her
with someone perhaps...

1904
01:43:58,764 --> 01:44:00,587
...more swarthy, darker.

1905
01:44:00,701 --> 01:44:03,221
We don't use the word
"Margaret" around Kevin.

1906
01:44:03,370 --> 01:44:07,494
He still hasn't warmed up to her.

1907
01:44:07,707 --> 01:44:09,333
- Margaret.
- (barks)

1908
01:44:09,443 --> 01:44:11,352
- Margaret.
- (barks)

1909
01:44:11,478 --> 01:44:13,136
See? Its the damnedest thing.

1910
01:44:13,246 --> 01:44:14,806
I have never farted in front of him.

1911
01:44:14,914 --> 01:44:17,216
Nor will I ever fart in front of him.

1912
01:44:17,351 --> 01:44:19,772
She farts in her sleep.

1913
01:44:19,919 --> 01:44:21,741
(Gilbertson) Would you consider
Margaret a good dancer?

1914
01:44:21,856 --> 01:44:24,954
You can tell by the way
she drinks her soda pop

1915
01:44:25,126 --> 01:44:27,395
that she's a good dancer.

1916
01:44:27,527 --> 01:44:28,704
(Gilbertson) Uh-huh. How, how...

1917
01:44:28,795 --> 01:44:33,051
How is the soda pop
relevant to the dancing?

1918
01:44:33,266 --> 01:44:34,860
I don't understand this.

1919
01:44:34,969 --> 01:44:37,783
- I call him... puppy.
- Pumpkin.

1920
01:44:37,938 --> 01:44:39,530
- Monkey.
- Daisy.

1921
01:44:39,638 --> 01:44:41,744
- Kiddo.
- Uh... Bird.

1922
01:44:41,876 --> 01:44:44,941
Sometimes I call him Rick.

1923
01:44:45,111 --> 01:44:46,519
(Gilbertson) How do you spell "Ramone?"

1924
01:44:46,613 --> 01:44:49,363
(thickly accented) R-A-M-O-N-E.

1925
01:44:49,516 --> 01:44:51,339
(Gilbertson) Could you do that
again in English, please?

1926
01:44:51,453 --> 01:44:54,201
When you say, you know, the
position in the relationship...

1927
01:44:54,354 --> 01:44:55,663
(Gilbertson) Top or bottom?

1928
01:44:55,756 --> 01:44:58,603
You're asking me a question
about who's on top?

1929
01:44:58,759 --> 01:45:00,416
(Gilbertson) You took an oath
when you walked in this office.

1930
01:45:00,526 --> 01:45:02,894
I did not take an oath.
When did I take an oath?

1931
01:45:03,030 --> 01:45:04,239
(Gilbertson) Laura shoulïve
done that, but she didn't.

1932
01:45:04,331 --> 01:45:06,120
- Thats OK.
- Who's Laura?

1933
01:45:06,233 --> 01:45:08,468
She's the girl behind you.
Don't look around.

1934
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:09,811
(Gilbertson) Which of
the following numbers

1935
01:45:09,903 --> 01:45:12,587
- is not a prime?
- Seventeen.

1936
01:45:12,739 --> 01:45:14,812
I'm sorry. Let me say the list, please.

1937
01:45:14,941 --> 01:45:15,923
I'm sorry?

1938
01:45:16,009 --> 01:45:17,219
(Gilbertson) He knew
your favorite color.

1939
01:45:17,310 --> 01:45:18,871
- Blue?
- (Gilbertson) Wrong!

1940
01:45:18,979 --> 01:45:20,441
- Red?
- No!

1941
01:45:20,548 --> 01:45:22,009
Dark... Maybe like a hunter green?

1942
01:45:22,116 --> 01:45:23,457
(Gilbertson) No. White.

1943
01:45:23,550 --> 01:45:24,761
- White?
- OK, moving on.

1944
01:45:24,851 --> 01:45:26,193
Favorite color is blue.

1945
01:45:26,286 --> 01:45:30,029
Whats her favorite color
when she's not at home?

1946
01:45:30,223 --> 01:45:31,564
I don't know.

1947
01:45:31,658 --> 01:45:33,348
(Gilbertson) Are you a citizen
of this country, Ramone?

1948
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:37,171
Yes, I'm a citizen!
(guffawing) Are you crazy?

1949
01:45:37,365 --> 01:45:39,251
(laughs)

1950
01:45:39,366 --> 01:45:42,148
What relevance a ball in a net

1951
01:45:42,302 --> 01:45:44,157
or a Fruit Roll-Up or a Pop-Tart

1952
01:45:44,271 --> 01:45:46,725
has to do with my
relationship with Andrew?

1953
01:45:46,873 --> 01:45:48,335
(Gilbertson) If you're
getting excited...

1954
01:45:48,441 --> 01:45:51,441
- Who are you engaged to?
- (sighs)

1955
01:45:51,612 --> 01:45:55,637
- Andrew.
- Very good. Got one right.

1956
01:45:55,850 --> 01:45:56,962
(Gilbertson) Who are you engaged to?

1957
01:45:57,051 --> 01:45:58,676
I'm engaged to Margaret Tate.

1958
01:45:58,785 --> 01:46:04,023
And on the wedding day,
who will be next to you?

1959
01:46:04,291 --> 01:46:06,494
I'm going to marry Margaret Tate.

1960
01:46:06,626 --> 01:46:09,211
- (Gilbertson) Final answer?
- That work? Yeah, final answer.

1961
01:46:09,362 --> 01:46:12,526
Is this a game show?
I don't understand what...

1962
01:46:12,699 --> 01:46:16,245
(sings God Bless America)

1963
01:46:19,773 --> 01:46:21,180
That's a great song.

1964
01:46:21,275 --> 01:46:22,934
(Gilbertson) That was beautiful.
That was really beautiful.

1965
01:46:23,043 --> 01:46:24,635
Mama Cass.

1966
01:47:19,292 --> 01:47:34,104
<font color=#ffff00>THE END
